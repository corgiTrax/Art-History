Also might indicate the evolutionary connection humans have with apes. The monkey is dressed in same suit as the man. It suggests that they are performers, perhaps in a circus.

0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",Statue of man and monkey,This image is of Michael Jackson and his pet monkey. I consider it very gaudy and probably was intentionally so.

0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",A man with a monkey.,"This first thing I think of is Michael Jackson and his pet monkey.

Both are dressed up in gold and have smiles on their faces. I find the statue unusual and odd. It makes a person wonder why the ape is dressed up like a man and why they are in gold. It is reminiscent of a religious figurine. ,
0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",I believe the subject of this piece is the concept of celebrity.,"This statue appears to depict the late King of Pop and his companion Bubbles. In the ancient world, a statue reclining in this manner might depict a warrior or hero. Here it depicts a modern entertainment celebrity. I believe the artist is making a critical statement on the nature of modern celebrity. This is emphasized by his use of gold and the unnaturally white depiction of the African-American Jackson: art idealizes, it reflects luxury and glamor, but taken to the extreme it can be repugnant in its falseness.

Both Michael Jackson and the monkey are gold and white, both of their lips are red. The image is displaying friendliness in wildlife, and that all creatures are equal/important.

0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",artistic rendering of human figure with chimpanzee.,I find it odd.  It puts me in a somewhat confused mood and I dislike the figure overall.  It looks like the image is trying to convey Michael Jackson sitting with a pet chimpanzee.

0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",man and a monkey ,I think it represents a calming peace. The man and the monkey both look happy and content to be together. It is a oneness with nature in both the fallen leaves and the bond between the man and the monkey.,
0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",Figurine of Michael Jackson,I automatically feel this is an older figurine both because of the gold color and because Michael has his beloved Pet monkey Bubbles with him.

But I feel creepy. For some reasons I don't like this little souvenir. Maybe their eyes are too dark and it's a big contrast of gold and black freaks me out.  I am not sure what artist wanted to pass to us, maybe how close we are too animals, how many similarities we have with these creations. ",
0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",This is a sculpture or figurine of a man and a monkey. ,"The mood seems to be bright and cheerful. With the bright Golf and White colors my mood is lifted. Also, in the picture the monkey is sitting on the mans lap which to me implies companionship or friendship.

It may speak to secrets and lies and mystery.",
0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",Michael Jackson with a monkey that could be Bubbles.,It is something breakable that someone would put up in their house if they are a big MJ fan. I feel a little happy and sad when I look at the image. I feel happy because I think this is one of the times Michael was at his happiest but also sad because of what happened to him in the years following this.,
0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",Michael Jackson and his monkey Bobo.,I think the image is trying to convey the love between man and animal.

The man has a certain resemblance to Michael Jackson.,The image shows a man sitting on the floor holding his pet chimpanzee. After seeing this image I feel this person is definitely an animal lover as his chimpanzee is wearing the same dress as the man. The image make me feel happy as the man seems pretty contented with his favorite pet on his lap. The overall mood of the image is positive. The strewn leaves in the floor indicate that the man is possibly sitting outside and enjoying the nature.,

0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",Michael Jackson and his pet monkey.,"The sentiment of the image conveys loneliness. The monkey is dressed in the same clothing as the person and both the person and the monkey have the same sort of content look on their faces. It's a lonely picture, of someone who (perhaps) does not connect with other people and who has replaced that disconnect with a monkey that can neither speak poorly of him, or good. It makes me feel sad, because I think that there are far too many lonely people in a world that's filled with people. I did some clinical work in a nursing home several years ago and the place almost smelled like loneliness. Many of the residents never had visitors. I would take a few minutes to just talk with the people who wanted to just talk, and I learned so many amazing things. They mainly told me stories about their lives. Many lived through the great depression and had so many amazing stories of survival during that time. I think that the elderly, (especially in America) are some of our most valuable treasures. ",
0,"Batch 1 - Jeff Koons ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" 1988",This is the image of a man and a monkey.,"Their clothes are matching which leads me to believe that they are close, like the monkey is a pet. The matching clothes and how they are positioned makes me feel like the monkey is more like a family member. Since there are only a man and the monkey in the photo, i feel like the monkey is also his best friend and with whom the man spends a lot of time with and cares deeply for. The expression on the man's face is sad but the monkey's facial expression is happy as if it were content just by being with the man who is the monkey's primary caregiver.",

1," Joseph Cornell ""Soap Bubble Set"" 1948",A pipe and memories,"I'm not sure what the sentiment is of this. It looks like a pipe, and in the smoke bubbles are shells and leaves. I would interpret this as memories someone has. Floating off into thin air. ",

1," Joseph Cornell ""Soap Bubble Set"" 1948",Surrealist Mixed Media Art Piece,This art piece is surrealist in nature with an image of a pipe blowing bubbles that contain various sea shells. This piece is interesting to look at from the eagle talon and bowl pipe to the bubbles with the sea shells. It has an almost day dream feel to it with a subtle hint towards humor with the pipe blowing bubbles instead of smoke. Additionally the piece has an slight calming effect went the mind drifts to the sea shells and thoughts of the ocean on a beautiful day to the beach.,
1," Joseph Cornell ""Soap Bubble Set"" 1948",It's a pipe with seashell smoke coming out,I don't know. It's trying to say the sea is going up in smoke I guess? I don't like it,

1," Joseph Cornell ""Soap Bubble Set"" 1948",seashells,"The mood of this piece is happy because the main focal point is white. The sentiment is innocence because white represents innocence. It looks like an elaborate pipe is blowing out seashells. Im honestly not sure what this image is trying to convey, I have never really understood abstract art and that is what i take this to be. This piece makes me feel slightly dumb because I don't understand what it is suppose to be.",

1," Joseph Cornell ""Soap Bubble Set"" 1948",pipe with shells,"A white ivory and wood pipe appears to be releasing ephemeral pictures of black and white photographs of fossils of ancient life forms. The pipe itself is in the shape of a claw holding the bowl. The pipe is in the shape of a mystical creature, but the blobs coming out of the pipe instead of smoke are of real, hard, microscope images of life long before humans. We as humans often create these myths, but when we find out the reality through science, we find what we don't know isn't terrifying like our imaginations. ",
1," Joseph Cornell ""Soap Bubble Set"" 1948",The subject of the image is form and imagination.,"The artist depicts an elaborate pipe, which appears to be a dragon holding a cup, out of which issues bubbles full of exquisitely formed shells. On one level, I think the artist is just celebrating the beauty of form for its own sake, with all of its complexities, delights and exquisite little details. On another level, I think this image (which on a realistic level is absurd) is a representation of the imagination: how the mind produces thoughts that, while nonsensical on the level of the real, are beautiful enough that they SHOULD be true... and in a way they area.",

I am not totally sure as to what is going on in this image. It looks as if it is trying to tell a story in some way.

There three different materials in this picture: wood, gypsum? and sea shells(mostly made up of calcium). Maybe the artist wanted to show how everything is connected in this world. Wood associated with nature; gypsum with humans; sea shells symbolizes again nature. So we are somewhere between, and all together we make one piece - a peaceful warrior. ",

In my opinion, the pipe represents the mouth, the images of ears floating up where smoke would normally be conveys words or expressions that people seem to hear, but a person may not feel as though they are actually being heard. The image makes me feel a sense of agreement.  Because there are so many ways that we can express things to others through words, bu the heart and feelings behind the true expression, or true emotion, sometimes has a form that makes it impossible to express no matter how many words are spoken to the hearers, they can never truly hear the heart.

2," Caravaggio ""boy with basket"" 1593",A man holding a basket of fruit,This is a rather realistic piece that in many ways feels more like a study.

2," Caravaggio ""boy with basket"" 1593",The subject of this image is beauty.,"This image plays with the still life, with the most prominent part of the picture being the exquisite display of the basket of fruit. On one level, I think, the artist is simply saying: 'Look how well I can depict all of these things!' On another, I think he's making a statement on beauty. By depicting the boy, his detailed shirt, and that varied and RIPE basket of fruit, he's saying that the artist's role is to take in and reproduce all forms of beauty. And perhaps he's suggesting that, rather than 'still life', the visual beauty of the fruit is just as profound as that of the living being. (Or maybe it's vice versa!)",

The image probably depicts a household servant who is carrying the fruit basket as the basket seems quite heavy from the way his muscles have contracted in the deltoid region.

It makes me feel hopeful because each experiences in our lives produces some soft of outcome that defines who we are. Those things can either make us stronger or break us.

(We are also given a glimpse of her face, which is blank, which suggests to me that she is not intended as a representation of an actual woman.)

I think it was trying to portray familiar images of everyday life. The image suggests that it was located in an area by the sea, so we see fish, seashells and seabirds displayed prominently.

I can imagine the young woman's chaperone is strolling behind her, and the young woman seems to be in deep thought at the moment.

She is probably thinking that she wished she put down her parasol, strip off her gloves and remove her corset! She doesn't appear to be very happy, as she isn't smiling and seems to be contemplating a serious matter. Perhaps, she is worried about being matched with an elderly man as her husband, because he has a title, riches and her parent's would consider him an excellent match. But, she would prefer a handsome, younger man...a man that may not have a title or riches, but makes her heart skip a beat.

11," Marcel Duchamp ""LHOOQ"" ",The Mona Lisa with a mustache and goatee drawn on,"I would guess that it is meant to be humorous, potentially satirical.

I think this makes you question the gender, as to ask yourself that perhaps Mona Lisa wasn't actually Mona Lisa, perhaps she was Monty Leonard back then? Perhaps the artist was in love with the one that did the sitting for the portrait, but since he was actually a male, he painted his lover as 'Mona Lisa', as a male would never have been accepted back in that time. It makes me feel how much we have progressed in our gender roles today, and how different times are for the sexes.",

It may have even been a rough draft or mock up made by da Vinci himself, or a modern day reiteration. The face and upper body of Mona Lisa are easily recognizable, and the addition of a goatee and lightened eye would be fairly obvious to anyone who has seen the original painting before. The color palette used in this image is also different from the original tones of the painting, which were very yellow / golden and highly contrasted.

It may have been done by the artist (or someone else) to demonstrate that it is a self portrait (of Leonardo Da Vinci). The color of the beard matches the color of the signature, indicating is is very likely the original artist added the facial hair. It seems reasonable to wonder if the original color was purple. It may have been added later, and pigment may have faded to the pale lavender like tone. It evokes amusement and whimsy. The alterations become the focus, but they also change the way one views the original subject. A double-take to assure the garments are of feminine fashion. A general androgyny is introduced.  The strength of the image is in wondering who added the facial hair, why they did it, and how it alters our perception of the woman. ",

It is really a beautiful image. His skin is positively porcelain.  I think it is a marvelous portrait.  I'd just have to stare at it.  I think it really conveys the essence of the man.

He is clean, and looks quite healthy in the face, another sign that he is probably wealthy enough to afford medical treatment and to avoid spoiled food. His features are soft and almost feminine. I might have mistook him for female, if not for the prominent sideburns. I don't think this picture is trying to convey anything special beyond being a portrait of an upper class male, which was common in 16th century art.

The lad seems to be fairly realistic looking so I think this portrait might have been painted after or during the time of Charles Manet. The colors are still very dark though as a Classical painting. The body seems to be strong and shoulders are wide. The hair flowing down the person's back shows of one that is sitting casually for his portrait.

It shows the young man with dramatic lighting, wearing a hat and a robe or cape; it makes me feel like this is someone important.

Some figures are abstract but some do look realistic just out of their original environment. There are many conical and serpent like shapes flowing through the composition to unify many parts of this picture and to show movement and energy. Though comedic, the brown color in the background tends to make the comedy less happy and more down to earth. The energy is there in shapes and movement but most of the color is neutral so therefore the energy tends to wane somewhat due to this brown background. Colors are not high energy at all so it seems to drain the whimsical away from the composition making a contrast between subject depiction and the neutrality of color. ",

18,"Batch - ""Book of Kells Chi Rho""",A tapestry.,"I am put off by the image.  I feel a tightness in my chest while looking at it, caused by my reflexive dislike of the symbol.  I think it is either the seal of a prominent Dark Ages family or perhaps a papal tribute.   Either way, it represents to me a period where the masses lived a brutish existence and knowledge was tightly controlled.  ",

18,"Batch - ""Book of Kells Chi Rho""",Religious symbols,"The ornate decorations surrounding the main structures of the picture remind me of patterns that are used on cathedrals and other houses of worship. Although the patterns look random parts of the picture are symmetrical and seem to bring a meaning to an otherwise abstract, ambiguous painting. The main shapes in the painting also look to be some form of writing or at least symbols which stand for something that would have been easily recognizable to the people of this time period, that combined with the writing at the bottom of the picture suggests it was created for the affluent of the time period that were literate.

When you think about how little resources people had back during the time when this image was made, you have to be amazed by the artistry of the person who designed it. It looks like a beautiful maze that I would never be able to solve. ",
18,"Batch - ""Book of Kells Chi Rho""",Colorful swirls which are possibly letters with gold gild accents.,"It seems calmingly alchemic, like the steam rising from milk when you are making hot cocoa.  As you add the cocoa, new swirls appear.  It feels meditative, and more sculptural than literal or figurative.  It is peaceful and does not create anxiety.",
18,"Batch - ""Book of Kells Chi Rho""",A capital P,"This image intrigues me. It looks damaged with age, but it's part of the design, it seems. This looks to be medieval, possibly from the Crusades era. It reminds me of Islamic design, but seems Western judging by the English letters and possible crosses. There is intense detail to the chaotic swirling patterns, but they are forced into a larger order that suggests royalty.  ",

19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",human figure.   This says about sexual anxiety,this is adult content. this is a graphic image,
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",7 human figures,These figures seem cold and miserable. The colors are sad. The nude figures are misshaped. It makes me feel anxious because the figures are clinging to one another. The women and child seem out of place. The nude female crouched in the background makes me afraid of poverty and death.,
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",several humans that appear to be greiving,"The painting is done in a muted dark blue/gray palette which is why I thought maybe the people in this painting are grieving. There are several people in the background slumped over each other possibly sobbing. The main subject appear to be a couple who is having their child taken away by a nun. The child's eyes are closed so he might be dead, and the father is pointing his finger at the nun telling her to take away the dead infant. I'm not sure why everyone is naked but everyone grieves differently so to each his own. This painting makes me feel sad because of the palette but also the subject appears rather grim.",
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",Sad embrace,"Well my automatic reaction to this painting is a feeling of sadness and longing. I can see that although many of the characters in this piece of art are very sad and forlorn, they are also being very vulnerable and almost seeking comfort from another. I think this painting is trying to convey the pain many of us feel though out our lives, but also the connections we form with others that often help us heal our pain. ",
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",A MAN AND TWO WOMEN,"TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE THIS MAN WAS CAUGHT BY HIS WIFE HAVING AN AFFAIR, IT MAKES ME FEEL COMPASSION FOR THE WIFE AND HATRED FOR THE OTHER TWO.",
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",a human painting,this image makes me feel a bit low .. there seem to be a man who's with a other woman and hugging her..while his wife with their child looks on .. he also gestures using his fingers to his wife to stay away from him .. this image shows polygamy that was prevalent in earlier days,
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",painting of teens and a woman holding a baby,I believe this picture is portraying what happens when teens have sex.  A baby that they are giving up.  The other sad people in the pictures also represent the depression from this also happening to them.  I believe the older woman holding the baby is taking the baby away from them to give up for adoption.  It is  a powerful picture but not a happy picture at all.  It is a picture telling a story to me.,
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",three people,The 'blueness' of the image portrays very cold feelings -- It seems that the couple on the left are being berated by the 'mother figure' to the right.,
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903","A nearly couple, embracing and a woman, clothed, holding a child. In the background:  paintings of paintings.  ","It seems rather sad to me.  I get that the woman holding the infant is casting judgment on the couple.  The ""paintings"" on the wall remind me of insanity.  

The nude woman seems to be hiding her face.  I'm wondering if the clothed woman is an older sister or mother of one of the others and the infant belongs to the couple.  ",
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",humans,I think it depicts people wanting a child and one woman who is deciding who should get the child she has.  Some of the characters are sad because they have been passed over for this child after bearing their souls,
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",Three adults and a small child.,It looks as if an artist is caught by his wife while he is cheating on her with the subject of one of his paintings. ,
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",Broken family,"This image immediately made me sad. It seems like the clothed woman is taking the child away from the naked couple. The posture of the images in the background (huddled) is one of sadness, and the wash of the blue gives it a feeling of grief or despair. ",
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",A man regards a woman and baby.,"If feels sad and tense. I think the man is telling the woman with the baby to stop or something, or stay away. The other woman is perhaps the ""other woman"" or maybe the one with the baby is the mother. It definitely carries negative connotation for me.",
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903","Painting of a woman with child, staring at a semi-nude couple.","The mood in the image is darkness.  I think that the imagery is a statement of the Church overcoming the natural baseness of man.  I think that is represented by the Madonna figure looking disapprovingly at the couple, representing their natural state.



This actually makes me a bit angry.  I reject the notion that we are damaged in someway at our birth and that superstition can raise us up.",
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",birth,To me it seems like the couple is giving up their child. Maybe there is a good reason they are giving this child to this woman it conveys an aura of sadness,
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",Shame of a carnal lifestyle,"The muted blues of this painting suggest it is supposed to be depressing if not thought provoking. The fact that only one person is fully clothed in the picture and holding a baby suggests that she is the innocent which is looking down at the people who are naked, possibly for their lifestyle. If indeed the baby in the picture is meant to be the couple's the look on the woman's face who is holding it is explained because she does not look happy with the couple. The naked couple in the picture signify carnal delights but the background images where the naked people are huddled close together or in a fetal position show that the lifestyle they chose is not as enjoyable as they led on.

19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",A semi nude man and woman couple and a clothed woman holding a baby with nude drawings in the background. ,All of the paintings in Picasso's blue period always make me feel rather melancholy while looking at them. I feel like this one in particular is a woman finding her husband has taken a lover whom he has used in his art. I feel the betrayal of the woman and sorry for the baby.  ,
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903","A couple, unclothed, and huddling together are observed by a robed mother with sleeping child.","It feels cold.  While there should be warmth between the man and woman holding each other, the look they receive from the mother is unsettling and judging.  The faces of the couple reflect they feel judged.  I'm not sure about the drawings on the back wall, perhaps it is a history of some kind.",
19," Pablo Picasso ""La Vie"" 1903",A couple approached by a woman with child,"There is depressed and shameful air to this painting despite the appearance of several embracing couples. It's reminiscent of a cheating husband caught with his lover by his wife and infant child, or Adam and Eve's confrontation with God moments before their expulsion. ",

I'd like to think they are pushing the horses to go as fast as they can, kicking up dirt and scaring the squirrels as they run. The leaves in the trees seem to be changing so this might be the last enjoyable ride before the snow starts to fall, and it gets too cold for racing.

The first being a a shape that looks like a tree with yellow and orange leaves, signifying fall. The middle portion is mainly white which would symbolize the winter. And then the last portion on the right has rich colors on the tree signifying spring and summer. The people and animals on the bottom of the photo are racing towards the spring and summer. Because it seems like there may be a family on the horses it is possible that the painting is showing a time period where people lived mostly off the land and the animals they were able to raise making the arrival of a warmer climate much anticipated by the people in the picture.
