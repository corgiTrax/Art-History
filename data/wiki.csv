0,Michael Jackson and Bubbles,Jeff Koons,"porcelain, sculpture, painted","Pop art, kitsch","Michael Jackson and Bubbles is a porcelain sculpture (42 x 70.5 x 32.5 in) by the American artist Jeff Koons. It was created in 1988 within the framework of his Banality series. The life-size porcelain sculpture depicts the American singer-songwriter Michael Jackson leaning back on a flower bed. On his lap reclines his domesticated chimpanzee Bubbles who clasps a white cloth. Jackson and his pet form an optical unit. They wear similar clothing, are colored homogeneously and parts of their bodies are paralleled with each other, such as Jackson's right hand and Bubbles' paw. The sculpture has been arranged in a triangular and multi-perspective composition. Bubbles was Jackson's domestic animal who was bought by the artist from a Texas research facility in 1985. It has been claimed by the media that he was Jackson's best and faithful friend who even joined the singer on his world tours and helped in the household. Jeff Koons used a press photo of Jackson and Bubbles as a template for his sculpture. It is almost identical to the artist's work except for a slight variation of the posture. Koons changed Jackson's direction of view and thus adjusted the composition to the requirements of a sculptural work which has to take into account many different viewing angles.

At the time the sculpture was created, Jackson had already become a world-famous performer. Having achieved a sales record with his album Bad, he was at the pinnacle of his career. Koons artwork can be read as a comment on the great media interest that has been directed at Jackson's life as musician and as a private person. Three of the Michael Jackson and Bubbles sculpture were made. One was sold at Sotheby's on 15 May 2001, when it was auctioned off to the record price of 5.6 million dollars The artist's proof is owned by the Broad Art Foundation of businessman and art collector Eli Broad and is displayed in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (It is now at The Broad Museum in Downtown Los Angeles). The two other versions are in Athens and in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Jeff Koons has stated that his works of art should reach the largest possible audience. For this purpose he sought inspiration in entertainment media, pop culture and Christian art. The depiction of a media effective person like Michael Jackson might have helped him to achieve this aim.[3] In the 1980s, which were characterized by a new consumer and media culture, Jackson enjoyed an enormous chart success and became a pop icon. Koons now overemphasized the King of Pop's icon-like manner paralleling him with Christian icons. The artist once said about the sculpture: I wanted to create him in a very god-like icon manner. But I always liked the radicality of Michael Jackson; that he would do absolutely anything that was necessary to be able to communicate with people. ¡ª Jeff Koons[3] Koons has stated that he was also inspired by the triangular composition of Michelangelo's Piet¨¤.[5] Furthermore, the work's material reminds of catholic mass-produced figures of saints which are usually manufactured in porcelain and gold leaf. Thus the sculpture becomes a kitschy object that is appealing for a wide public and the art market.[6] Koons claims that he wanted to depict Jackson as a new redemptive figure who enables people to discover their own cultural mythology.[7] Michael Jackson and Bubbles has also been read as a symbol of the human desire for self-discovery.[8] Jackson demonstrated publicly his childlike personality and tried to reinvent himself by means of plastic surgery. Koons was fascinated by the self transformations of Jackson and the way he played with images such as himself against Bubbles.[3] The assimilated chimp on his lap underlines this aspect of self-exploration. He is a traditional symbol in fine arts which serves to mirror h","Over the past thirty-five years, Jeff Koons has become one of the most popular, influential, controversial, and important artists of the postwar generation. Throughout his career, he has pioneered new approaches to the readymade, tested the boundaries between advanced art and mass culture, and challenged the limits of industrial fabrication in works of great beauty and emotional intensity. Outside of his studio, Koons has transformed the relationship of artists to the cult of celebrity and the global market to become one of the best-known visual artists alive today. Jeff Koons: A Retrospective is the artists first large-scale museum presentation in New York and also the first time that a single artists work will fill nearly the entire Museum. Organized by Nancy and Steve Crown Family Curator and Associate Director of Programs Scott Rothkopf, the exhibition surveys more than three decades of Jeff Koonss art and includes approximately 140 works across a variety of mediums. On view from June 27 through October 19, 2014, this landmark exhibition is the Whitneys grand finale in its uptown Breuer building before the Museum opens its new building downtown in spring 2015. Jeff Koons: A Retrospective features a range of works from each stage of the artists career, representing the following series: Inflatables, Pre-New, The New, Equilibrium, Luxury & Degradation, Statuary, Banality, Made in Heaven, Easyfun, Celebration, Popeye, Hulk Elvis, Antiquity, and Gazing Ball. In addition, the Whitney is showing several new pieces by Koons, including the monumental Play-Doh, which the artist has been working on for more than twenty years. Rothkopf remarks: Its hard to think of another living artist who has pushed as many aesthetic and cultural limits as Koons has.  In his Banality series 1988 he produced sculptural pairings such as the pop singer Michael Jackson and his pet chimpanzee (in Michael Jackson and Bubbles 1988). This series also included art magazine ads, starring Koons himself, which played on his newfound art-world celebrity. The 1980s were a time of excess with the decade often referred to as the decade of greed. Koons works played on such decadence. Koons Banality sculpture series, released in 1988, presents a commentary on American society and its insatiable appetite for glamorous commodities. Fashioned out of porcelain, these large works of kitsch present familiar and innocuous pop and historical motifs in disturbing, occasionally sexualized, contexts. Banality. 

Imagine walking into an art gallery and seeing overgrown toys, or cartoon characters presented as sculpture.  If, in 1988, you had wandered into the Sonnabend Gallery on West Broadway in New York City, this is indeed what you would have witnessed: it was an exhibition entitled ¡°Banality¡± by New York artist Jeff Koons presenting some twenty sculptures in porcelain and polychromed wood. The work certainly strikes as an affront to taste: the sculptures are highly polished and gleaming. The colors¡ªmuted pale blue, pink, lavender, green and yellowish gold¡ªseem to belong to the 1950s and 60s. The glossy textures look garish and factory-made, surfaces one associates with inexpensive commercial art. One would almost want to call these sculptures ¡°figurines¡± were it not for their size. To add to this catalogue of horrors, the artist had farmed out the actual production to German and Italian artisans who made each work in triplicate!  ¡°Banality¡± thus debuted simultaneously in New York, Chicago, and Cologne.

Postmodernism: the artist as critic of mass culture

Provocation is a mainstay of the modernist avant-gardes reaching at least as back as far as when Marcel Duchamp¡¯s Fountain of 1917, an ordinary urinal, was proposed as an artwork  (""t-garde"" refers to artists whose work challenges established ideas).  But whereas Duchamp eventually accrued near-mythical status, that same critical reception for Koons was not forthcoming¡ªin fact, he would become one of the first artists of this period to achieve a level of success that depended more on the art market than on art criticism. He is still reviled. Only recently a review described Koons as ¡°Duchamp with lots of ostentatious trimmings.""] It's easy to see why he has continued to provoke: the postmodern 1980s inaugurated the contemporary sense of the artist as a critical and serious interrogator of mass culture and mass media.

Cindy Sherman, one of the most prominent artists of that period, made photographs of herself that paraded the clich¨¦s of femininity before an audience that consumed critical theory about the constructed nature of reality and the oppressive manipulations of mass media.

1,Soap Bubble Set,Joseph Cornell,"assemblage, collage","Surrealism, assemblage","Joseph Cornell (December 24, 1903 ¨C December 29, 1972) was an American artist and sculptor, one of the pioneers and most celebrated exponents of assemblage. Influenced by the Surrealists, he was also an avant-garde experimental filmmaker. Cornell's most characteristic art works were boxed as""mblages created from found objects. These are simple shadow boxes, usually fronted with a glass pane, in which he arranged eclectic fragments of photographs or Victorian bric a brac, in a way that combines the formal austerity of Constructivism with the lively fantasy of Surrealism. Many of his boxes, such as the famous Medici Slot Machine boxes, are interactive and are meant to be handled.[9] Like Kurt Schwitters, Cornell could create poetry from the commonplace. Unlike Schwitters, however, he was fascinated not by refuse, garbage, and the discarded, but by fragments of once beautiful and precious objects he found on his frequent trips to the bookshops and thrift stores of New York.[10] His boxes relied on the Surrealist use of irrational juxtaposition, and on the evocation of nostalgia, for their appeal. Cornell never regarded himself as a Surrealist; although he admired the work and technique of Surrealists like Max Ernst and Ren¨¦ Magritte, he disavowed the Surrealists' ""lack magic"", claiming that he only wished to make white magic with his art. Cornell's fame as the leading American ""Surrealist"" allowed him to befriend several members of the Surrealist movement when they settled in the United States during the Second World War. Later he was claimed as a herald of pop art and installation art. Cornell often made series of boxed assemblages that reflected his various interests: the Soap Bubble Sets, the Medici Slot Machine series, the Pink Palace series, the Hotel series, the Observatory series, and the Space Object Boxes, among others. Also captivated with birds, Cornell created an Aviary series of boxes, in which colorful images of various birds were mounted on wood, cut out, and set against harsh white backgrounds.[3] In addition to creating boxes and flat collages and making short art films, Cornell also kept a filing system of over 160 visual-documentary ""dossiers"" on themes that interested him; the dossiers served as repositories from which Cornell drew material and inspiration for boxes like his ""penny arcade"" portrait of Lauren Bacall. He had no formal training in art, although he was ext","Souce 1: This box was first shown in an exhibition William Copley organized at his Beverly Hills gallery in 1948, the entire contents of which he had bought from Cornell. The show was, in Copley¡¯s words, an ¡°enormous failure.¡± Copley attributed this to the fact that his installation transformed the gallery into one large box. Plastering the walls and ceiling with the blue-and-white catalogues and scattering clay pipes among the boxes displayed on glass shelves, he created a whole artwork, which he felt inhibited the public from entering (see Bill Copley, ¡°Joseph Cornell,¡± in New York, Castelli, Feigen, Corcoran,?Joseph Cornell Portfolio, 1976, exh. cat., n. pag.).

2,Boy with a basket of fruit ,Michelangelo Merisi di Caravaggio,oil on canvas,"Baroque, ","The painting dates from the time when Caravaggio, newly arrived in Rome from his native Milan, was making his way in the competitive Roman art world. The model was his friend and companion, the Sicilian painter Mario Minniti, at about 16 years old. The work was in the collection of Giuseppe Cesari, the Cavaliere d'Arpino, seized by Cardinal Scipione Borghese in 1607, and may therefore date to the period when Caravaggio worked for d'Arpino ""painting flowers and fruits"" in his workshop; but it may date from a slightly later period when Caravaggio and Minniti had left Cavalier d'Arpino's workshop (January 1594) to make their own way selling paintings through the dealer Costantino. Certainly it cannot predate 1593, the year Minniti arrived in Rome. It is believed to predate more complex works from the same period (also featuring Minniti as a model) such as The Fortune Teller and the Cardsharps (both 1594), the latter of which brought Caravaggio to the attention of his first important patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. Vittorio Sgarbi notes certain Murillesque portraiture qualities in the painting that could easily point to other painters in the Arpino workshop.[1] At one level the painting is a genre piece designed to demonstrate the artist's ability to depict everything from the skin of the boy to the skin of a peach, from the folds of the robe to the weave of the basket. The fruit is especially exquisite, and Professor Jules Janick of the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture at Purdue University, Indiana, has analysed them from a horticulturalist's perspective: The basket ... contains a great many fruits, all in nearly perfect condition and including a bi-colored peach with a bright red blush; four clusters of grapes ¡ª two black, one red, and one ""hite;"" a ripe pomegranate split open, disgorging its red seeds; four figs, two of them dead-ripe, black ones, both split and two light-colored; two medlars; three apples¡ªtwo red, one blushed and the other striped, and one yellow with a russet basin and a scar; two branches with small pears, one of them with five yellow ones with a bright red cheek and the other, half-hidden, with small yellow, blushed fruits. There are also leaves showing various disorders: a prominent virescent grape leaf with fungal spots and another with a white insect egg mass resembling that of the oblique banded leaf roller (Choristoneura rosaceana), and peach leaves with various spots. The analysis indicates that Caravaggio is being realistic, in capturing only what was in the fruit basket; he idealizes neither their ripeness nor their arrangement¡ªyet almost miraculously, we are still drawn in to look at it; for the viewer it is very much a beautiful and exquisite subject. ","This early genre painting by Caravaggio (Fig. 3) is of a sensual young boy holding a huge basket filled with fruit. The model has been identified as Mario Minniti, who appears in many of the early works, and who became a painter in his own right. The basket, the main focus of the painting, contains a great many fruits, all in nearly perfect condition and including a bicolored peach with a bright red blush; four clusters of grapes¡ªtwo black, one red, and one ""hite;"" a ripe pomegranate split open, disgorging its red seeds; four figs, two of them dead-ripe, black ones, both split and two light-colored; two medlars; three applestwo red, one blushed and the other striped, and one yellow with a russet basin and a scar; two branches with small pears, one of them with five yellow ones with a bright red cheek and the other, half-hidden, with small yellow, blushed fruits. There are also leaves showing various disorders: a prominent virescent grape leaf with fungal spots and another with a white insect egg mass resembling that of the oblique banded leaf roller (Choristoneura rosaceana), and peach leaves with various spots. Incongruously, there are two sprigs with reddish foliage, perhaps mint. While the display of fruits is beautiful, it does not have the super-realism characteristic of some of the later paintings. 
However, John Spike has led me to a vast literature on the erotic imagery of fruit paintings by Renaissance artists (see Morel, 1985; Von Lates, 1995; Lecoq 2000). There seems no doubt that Caravaggio does indeed use subtly erotic double entendres in at least two paintings: Self Portrait as Bacchus (Von Lates, 1995) and Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge, the latter based on similarities with Giovanni da Udine¡¯s obvious pornographic allusions found in the festoon in the loggia of Agostino Chigi at the Farn¨¦sina bordering Raphael's Cupid and Psyche (Vasari, 1550; Morel, 1985).

Spike (2002) assumes the stone ledge is an altar table. The profusion of fruits is described with both religious and erotic overtones:
...A profuse harvest of late summer fruits, squashes, and melons, fills its surface, dramatically illuminated from above. The allusion is again to Amos's likening of the imminent judgment to the end of the summer season.

3,Broadway Boggie Woogie,Piet Mondrian,oil on canvas,"Neo-Plasticism, De Stijl, pure abstraction","Broadway Boogie Woogie is a painting by Piet Mondrian completed in 1943, shortly after he moved to New York in 1940. Compared to his earlier work, the canvas is divided into a much larger number of squares. Although he spent most of his career creating abstract work, this painting is inspired by clear real-world examples: the city grid of Manhattan, and the Broadway boogie woogie music to which Mondrian loved to dance.[1] The painting was bought by the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins for the price of $800 at the Valentine Gallery in New York City, after Martins and Mondrian both exhibited there in 1943.[2] Martins later donated the painting to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.[3]","(Source 1) Mondrian arrived in New York in 1940, one of the many European artists who moved to the United States to escape World War II. He fell in love with the city immediately. He also fell in love with boogie-woogie music, to which he was introduced on his first evening in New York, and he soon began, as he said, to put a little boogie-woogie into his paintings. Mondrian's aesthetic doctrine of Neo-Plasticism restricted the painter's means to the most basic kinds of line¡ªthat is, to straight horizontals and verticals¡ªand to a similarly limited color range, the primary triad of red, yellow, and blue plus white, black, and the grays between. But Broadway B""ie Woogie omits black and breaks Mondrian's once uniform bars of color into multicolored segments. Bouncing against each other, these tiny, blinking blocks of color create a vital and pulsing rhythm, an optical vibration that jumps from intersection to intersection like the streets of New York. At the same time, the picture is carefully calibrated, its colors interspersed with gray and white blocks in an extraordinary balancing act. Mondrian's love of boogie-woogie must have come partly because he saw its goals as analogous to his own: ""destruction of melody which is the destruction of natural appearance; and construction through the continuous opposition of pure means¡ªdynamic rhythm.""    The pictorial language of geometric abstraction, based on the use of simple geometric forms placed in nonillusionistic space and combined into nonobjective compositions, evolved as the logical conclusion of the Cubist destruction and reformulation of the established conventions of form and space. Initiated by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in 19089, Cubism subverted the traditional depiction relying upon the imitation of forms of the surrounding visual world in the illusionisticpost-Renaissanceperspectival space. The High Analytic Cubist phase, which reached its peak in mid-1910, made available to artists the planarity of overlapping frontal surfaces held together by a linear grid. The next phaseSynthetic Cubism, 191214introduced the flatly painted synthesized shapes, abstract space, and constructional elements of the composition. These three aspects became the fundamental characteristics of abstract geometric art. The freedom of experimentation with different materials and spatial relationships between various compositional parts, which evolved from the Cubist practice of collage and papiers collés (1912), also emphasized the flatness of the picture surfaceas the carrier of applied elementsas well as the physical reality of the explored forms and materials. Geometric abstraction, through the Cubist process of purifying art of the vestiges of visual reality, focused on the inherent two-dimensional features of painting.

4,"Vampire, Love and Pain",Edvard Munch,oil on canvas,"Symbolism, German Expressionism","The painting shows a woman with long flame-red hair kissing a man on the neck, as the couple embrace.[1] Although others have seen in it ""a man locked in a vampire's tortured embrace ¨C her molten-red hair running along his soft bare skin,""3] Munch himself always claimed it showed nothing more than ""just a woman kissing a man on the neck"".[1] The painting was first called ""Vampire"" by Munch's friend, the critic Stanislaw Przybyszewski. Przybyszewski saw the painting on exhibition and described it as ""a man who has become submissive, and on his neck a biting vampire's face.""[4]

Edvard Munch (/m??k/;[1] Norwegian: [??dv¨»? mu?k] ( listen); 12 December 1863 ¨C 23 January 1944) was a Norwegian painter and printmaker whose intensely evocative treatment of psychological themes built upon some of the main tenets of late 19th-century Symbolism and greatly influenced German Expressionism in the early 20th century. One of his most well-known works is The Scream of 1893.Frieze of Life¡ªA Poem about Life, Love and Death[edit] In December 1893, Unter den Linden in Berlin was the location of an exhibition of Munch's work, showing, among other pieces, six paintings entitled Study for a Series: Love. This began a cycle he later called the Frieze of Life¡ªA Poem about Life, Love and Death. ""ze of Life"" motifs, such as The Storm and Moonlight, are steeped in atmosphere. Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as Rose and Amelie and Vampire. In Death in the Sickroom, the subject is the death of his sister Sophie, which he re-worked in many future variations. The dramatic focus of the painting, portraying his entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow. In 1894, he enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding Anxiety, Ashes, Madonna and Women in Three Stages (from innocence to old age).[51] Around the start of the 20th century, Munch worked to finish the ""Frieze"". He painted a number of pictures, several of them in larger format and to some extent featuring the Art Nouveau aesthetics of the time. He made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting Metabolism (1898), initially called Adam and Eve. This work reveals Munch's preoccupation with the ""fall of man"" and his pessimistic philosophy of love. Motifs such as The Empty Cross and Golgotha (both c. 1900) reflect a metaphysical orientation, and also reflect Munch's pietistic upbringing. The entire Frieze was shown for the first time at the secessionist exhibition in Berlin in 1902.[52] ""The Frieze of Life"" themes recur throughout Munch's work but he especially focused on them in the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped the depths of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death.[53] These themes are expressed in paintings such as The Sick Child (1885), Love and Pain (retitled Vampire; 1893¨C94), Ashes (1894), and The Bridge. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see Puberty and Love and Pain) or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see Separation, Jealousy, and Ashes). Munch often uses shadows and rings of color around his figures to emphasize an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity.[54] These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artist's sexual anxieties, though it could also be argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimi"" regarding human existence.[55] Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as Madonna, Hands and Puberty, and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. Munch hated to part with his paintings because he thought of his work as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his most famous paintings, including those in this series.[56] Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, ""My art is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life¡ªit is, therefore, ","Adolf Paul, a friend and admirer of August Strindberg, remembered visiting Munch one day in the artist's studio. He was painting from a model with long, flame-red hair that fell over her shoulders like congealed blood. ""'Kneel down in front of her,' he shouted at me. 'Place your head against her.' I obeyed. She leaned forward over me and pressed her lip against my neck, her red hair spilling over me. Munch started painting, and before long he hand completed his Vampire."" In its original painted form and as part of Munch's Firenze of Life, which contained all of his major images about human existence, the image now called Vampire was simply entitled Love and Pain. Some of its central importance in Munch's work may be gleaned from the fact that Munch considered Vampire and Madonna to be pendants; the artist exhibited the paintings of the subjects together in the early 1890s, made the first versions of the lithographs in 1895, and then returned to them for reworking in color in 1902. The motif probably crystallized from a number of disparate sources. Munch wrote that the earliest sketches for the motif dated from 1885-1886, though Reinhold Heller states that the earliest known drawing in fact dates from 1890 and corresponds to an ""inter-mezzo"" penned by the artist in a notebook: ""He sat with his arm around her body. Her head was so near to him. it seemed so remarkable to have her eyes, her mouth, her breasts so near to him... And he laid his head between her breasts. He felt her blood stream through her veins. He listened to the beat of her heart. He buried his face in her lap. She lowered her head down on him and he felt two warm, burning lips on his neck. A shudder passed through his body, a shudder of voluptousness. And he pressed her convulsively to him. "" Additionally, Pal Hougen has suggested two further literary sources from which Munch might have drawn: a part of a novel that the artist himself had begun early in the 1890s, and a poem by his Danish friend Emanuel Goldstein, which had been published in 1892 in the poet's collection Alruner. 

Munch observed that the title was what made the image ""literary."" ""In fact,"" he wrote, ""It is just a woman kissing a man on the neck."" He did not adopt the title Vampire until after the 1893 exhibition in Berlin of the Love series, which included an oil on canvas version of this motif.... It came from a description of the image by Stanislaw Przybyszewski, who made trenchant commentaries on each work: ""A man who has become submissive, and on his neck a biting vampire's face, the background, a remarkable and chaotic mixture of blue, violet, green, yellow spots of colour melting into each other, flowing, layered next to each other, and sharp like small crystalline forms. There is something horribly peaceful, bereft of passion in this painting; an immeasurable fatality of resignation.""

And the following year Strindberg wrote about the painting in his famously cynical appraisal of Munch's Paris exhibition: ""A shower of gold falling on a despairing figure kneeling before his worse self and imploring the favor of being stabbed to death with her hairpin. Golden ropes binding him to each and to suffering. Rain of blood falling in torrents over the madman in quest of unhappiness, the divine unhappiness of being loved, or rather of loving."" 

So important was this motif to Munch that he undertook to rework it in graphic form in 1895, his first full year of printmaking; it was printed originally by Lassally and then possibly by Clot in Paris. Munch began with a first version (erroneously called a state by Schiefler) in which the figure, reversed form the orientation of the painting, are positioned near a curtained window. He then rid the composition of any reference to a setting and placed the figures into a claustrophobic, densely worked flat space, with a looming black shadow enclosing them. The tangled stroke create a pervasive sense of danger and perversity, belying Munch's assetion that the image merely represents a kiss on the neck and forcing the beholder into a fearful confrontation with this deadly act. Munch hand-colered quite a few impressions of this black and white lithograph... It is clear that Munch felt strongly that Vampire was visually and iconographically incomplete as a monochrome image. The fresh and vivid impression shows the artist... Most important was his choice of red wash for the serpentine strands of hair on the woman. Munch has observed of the hair of a lover: ""It has twisted itself around me like blood-red snakes--its finest threads had entangled themselves in my heart."" And so important was color to this image--especially the readness of the hair--that Munch decided to print that red rather than simply applying it on each impression. Munch's exploration of color on this image led to some of his most complex and ingenious solution to the problem of color painting. The hair was the most important element. The Vampire images exhibit the extraordinary scope of Munch's technical creativity and remain endlessly suggestive.",,,,,,,,

Although the eruption was devastating, the layers of ash covering the abandoned town preserved artworks, like the mosaics of the House of the Faun, which would have otherwise been likely destroyed or decayed due to the passage of time. The House of the Faun was named for the bronze statue of the dancing faun located, originally, on the lip of the impluvium, a basin for catching rainwater; it has been moved to the center of the impluvium, as seen in the picture to the right. Fauns are spirits of untamed woodland, which literate and Hellenized Romans often connected to Pan and Greek satyrs, or wild followers of the Greek god of wine and agriculture, Dionysus. It is purely decorative sculpture of a high order: ""the pose is light and graceful,"" Sir Kenneth Clark observed,[4] the modeling well understood, the general sense of movement admirably sustained,"" though he missed in its suavity the stimulus of sharper contrasts to be found in Renaissance nudes. Archaeologists discovered an inscription bearing the cognomen Saturninus, suggesting that the dwelling was owned by the important gens, or clan, Satria; a ring bearing the family name Cassius was also found, indicating that someone of the Cassii family married into the gens Satria and lived in the House of the Faun.[5] ","saic, in art, decoration of a surface with designs made up of closely set, usually variously coloured, small pieces of material such as stone, mineral, glass, tile, or shell.

Mosaic also differs from inlay in the size of its components.

Pollitt: The House of the Faun, in fact, provides the best introduction possible to the quality and the variety of the Hellenistic mosaics at Pompeii. Upon entering the house, at the inner end of the fauces (entrance vestibule), one was immediately confronted with the familiar motif of theatrical masks entwined in a network of fruits, garlands, and flowers [236]. Proceeding into the Tuscan atrium of the house one encountered a series of delightful mosaics with generic decoration. In the ala (wing) to the right a cat creeps through a larder stocked with a partridge, ducks, fish, and shellfish [237].

6,Deer in the Forest ,Franz Marc,"painting, oil on canvas","Cubism, German Expressionism","Most of his mature work portrays animals,[4] usually in natural settings. His work is characterized by bright primary color, an almost cubist portrayal of animals, stark simplicity and a profound sense of emotion. Even in his own time, his work attracted notice in influential circles. Marc gave an emotional meaning or purpose to the colors he used in his work: blue was used to portray masculinity and spirituality, yellow represented feminine joy, and red encased the sound of violence. After the National Socialists took power, they suppressed modern art; in 1936 and 1937, the Nazis condemned the late Marc as an entarteter K¨¹nstler (degenerate artist) and ordered approximately 130 of his works removed from exhibition in German museums. His painting ¡°Landscape With Horses¡± was dis""red in 2011 along with more than a thousand other paintings, in the Munich apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt whose dealer father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was a collector of Modernist art the Nazis called ¡°degenerate.¡±[5] One of Marc's best-known paintings is Tierschicksale (Animal Destinies or Fate of the Animals), which hangs in the Kunstmuseum Basel. Marc had completed the work in","A summation of Franz Marc's the deer theme is Deer in the Forest, 1914. Amidst and integrated with the form of the deer is a panoply of force lines and transparent planes; an underlying organization of these exists in the pattern of parallel diagonals moving downward from the right and left edge, meeting in the middle. A secondary pattern exists in the rectilinear planes of color on the left opposing circular patterns on the right. while a blue mountain is absent, a smaller triangle encloses two of the deer; it and the blue tree at the left edge provide an uplifting quality. Contrasting the blue is the intense red throughout the center of the picture, oranges at top and bottom, and the feathery black in the upper right. The all-over organization of the canvas uniting animal to landscape, diminishes the heroism of the animal subject as depicted by Marc in 1911. Supporting Marc's latest conception of the world was Wilhelm Ostwald's theory of energy, in which matter is considered illusory. Only energy lines reveal appearance such as it is. In Deer in the Forest, 1914, this conception results in an energized atmosphere of randomness and chaos. the sense of an inchoate environment demonstrates both Marc's feeling of the world as a whole and his developing urge to represent Creation, and aspiration that is present in the works of Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee.",,,,,,,,

He is best known for his paintings of bustling Parisian modernity and leisure in the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Though celebrated as a colorist with a keen eye for capturing the movement of light and shadow, Renoir started to explore Renaissance painting in the middle of his career, which led him to integrate more line and composition into his mature works and create some of his era's most timeless canvases.
Working alongside Claude Monet, Renoir was essential to developing Impressionist style in the late 1860s, but there is a decidedly human element to his work that sets him apart. Renoir had a brilliant eye for both intimate domesticity and the day's fashions, and his images of content families and well-dressed Parisian pleasure seekers created a bridge from Impressionism's more experimental aims to a modern, middle-class art public. Renoir was the first Impressionist to perceive the potential limitations of an art based primarily on optical sensation and light effects. Though his discoveries in this field would always remain integral to his art, he reasserted the necessity of composition and underlying structure in modern painting, achieving in his mature work a structured, monumental style that acknowledged the strengths of High Renaissance art. Renoir's example became indispensible for the major French movements of high modernism: Fauvism and Cubism. Like Renoir, the progenitors of these styles focused on issues of color, composition, and depth rather than quick sketches of individual moments. His composed, vivid paintings created a vital bridge from earlier colorists like Raphael, Peter Paul Rubens, Jean-Antoine Watteau, and Eug¨¨ne Delacroix to the twentieth-century giants Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.","Famed for his sensual nudes and charming scenes of pretty women, Auguste Renoir was a far more complex and thoughtful painter than generally assumed. He was a founding member of the Impressionist movement, nevertheless he ceased to exhibit with the group after 1877. From the 1880s until well into the twentieth century, he developed a monumental, classically inspired style that influenced such avant-garde giants as Pablo Picasso. By the late 1880s and early 1890s, Renoir had shifted his investigation of the old masters from linear classicism to the coloristic traditions of Titian and Rubens as well as the unabashedly sensual beauty of eighteenth-century French art. In the early twentieth century, despite old age and declining health, Renoir persisted in artistic experimentation. He took up sculpture, hiring a young assistant and collaborator, Richard Guino, to create models after his designs. He continued to paint portraits and his Tilla Durieux is arguably the finest of his late portraits (61.101.13). The pyramidal composition, lavish costume, and textiles framing the sitter derive from Titian¡¯s portraits, attesting to Renoir¡¯s continued admiration of Renaissance art. The warm, red tonalities and expansive sense of monumentality, however, are features of his late style. During this p",,,,,,,,
8,Mourner ,Jean de la Huerta,tomb sculpture,"Burgundian Court, Northern Renaissance","De la Huerta remained relatively unknown until the end of the last century, uncovered by the research of the Mus¨¦e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon in 1972. In collaboration with Antoine Le Moiturier, he sculpted the tombs for Duke John the Fearless and Margaret of Bavaria, which currently reside at the Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy.[1] The job was originally assigned to the workshop of Claus Sluter, but went to Le Moiturier and De la Huerta.
","During Philip the Bolds reign, an art style known as International Gothic was favored in Burgundy and throughout much of Europe. Its flat, linear forms were elegant, delicate, and decorative. Philips marriage to Margaret, countess of Flanders, extended his power into Flemish territories and also brought important changes to Burgundian art. The solidity and realism that characterized Flemish art were combined in Burgundy with International Gothic. Art was produced in workshops headed by a master artist. To head the ducal art workshop, Philip chose the Netherlandish artist Claus Sluter. Sluters realistic style became the hallmark of art made in Dijon, the capital of Burgundy. Careful detail, everyday themes, naturalism, and ornate decoration typify the Dijon style. Figures are clothed in voluminous drapery that communicates emotion, as in the mourner statues. Sluter drafted plans for Philip the Bolds tomb but died after sculpting only a small part of it. His nephew, Claus de Werve, completed the tomb, using Sluters design. Philip¡¯s son, J",,,,,,,,
9,Jeanne (Spring),Edouard Manet,oil on canvas,Impressionism,"Édouard Manet was a French painter. He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.

Born into an upper-class household with strong political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed in the world of painting. His early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) and Olympia, both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism. Today, these are considered watershed paintings that mark the genesis of modern art. The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time, and develop his own style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.

Manet's public career lasted from 1861, the year of his first participation in the Salon, until his death in 1883. His extant works, as catalogued in 1975 by Denis Rouart and Daniel Wildenstein, comprise 430 oil paintings, 89 pastels, and more than 400 works on paper.[27] The grave of Manet at Passy Although harshly condemned by critics who decried its lack of conventional finish, Manet's work had admirers from the beginning. One was ?mile Zola, who wrote in 1867: ""We are not accustomed to seeing such simple and direct translations of reality. Then, as I said, there is such a surprisingly elegant awkwardness ... it is a truly charming experience to contemplate this luminous and serious painting which interprets nature with a gentle brutality.""[28] The roughly painted style and photographic lighting in Manet's paintings was seen as specifically modern, and as a challenge to the Renaissance works he copied or used as source material. He rejected the technique he had learned in the studio of Thomas Couture ¨C in which a painting was constructed using successive layers of paint on a dark-toned ground ¨C in favor of a direct, alla prima method using opaque paint on a light ground. Novel at the time, this method made possible the completion of a painting in a single sitting. It was adopted by the Impressionists, and became the prevalent method of painting in oils for generations that followed.[29] Manet's work is considered ""rly modern"", partially because of the opaque flatness of his surfaces, the frequent sketchlike passages, and the black outlining of figures, all of which draw attention to the surface of the picture plane and the material quality of paint. The art historian Beatrice Farwell says Manet ""has been universally regarded as the Father of Modernism. With Courbet he was among the first to take serious risks with the public whose favour he sought, the first to make alla prima painting the standard technique for oil painting and one of the first to take liberties with Renaissance perspective and to offer ¡®pure painting¡¯ as a source of aesthetic pleasure. He was a pioneer, again with Courbet, in the rejection of humanistic and historical subject-matter, and shared with Degas the establishment of modern urban life as acceptable material for high art."". ","Source 1: A chic young woman in a day dress with floral accents holds a parasol against a background of exuberant foliage. She looks straight ahead, a picture of poise and detachment even as she seems fully aware of the viewer's admiring gaze. Representing aspiring Parisian actress Jeanne Demarsy as the embodiment of Spring, this portrait debuted at the last major public exhibition of Manet's life, the Paris Salon of 1882. For more than two decades, Manet's paintings were rejected by the Salon or met with controversy; Spring was the most unalloyed success of the artist's Salon career, a career that ended tragically a year later when Manet died of causes related to syphilis. Appealing to critics primarily on account of Jeanne's charm, Spring also showcased Manet's mastery of his medium. The painting exhibits a marvelous range of brushwork, from the thin, delicate floral touches on the dress to the smooth handling of Jeanne's face and the broad, sketch-like strokes of the backdrop. The painting's sensual handling and bright, vibrant palette evoke the pleasures of the season it celebrates. When composing Spring, Manet had in view both the latest fashion trends and old artistic traditions. An avid connoisseur of feminine couture, he pieced together Jeanne's ensemble himself by scouring dressmakers' and milliners' shops. Posing his model in the studio, however, he referred to portrait conventions of the early Italian Renaissance, presenting her half-length, in profile, and against a mass of greenery. More than just an ephemeral ""fashion-plate,"" Manet's archetypal Spring was conceived as a picture for the ages, summarizing his modern epoch through the figure of a beautiful Parisienne.  

Souce 2: From the mid-1860s until his final year, Manet was the pioneer and leading exemplar of a revolutionary new style and its contemporary content. This portrait of the actress Jeanne Demarsy, cast as an allegory of spring, is the very climax of Manet¡¯s approach in his painting to femininity and fashion, consummately manifest in the artist¡¯s ground-breaking modern painterly style. Le Printemps, completed in 1881 and offered here, was one of two paintings the artist submitted to the Salon of 1882; the other was his supreme masterpiece, Un Bar aux Folies-Berg¨¨re, 1881-1882. This masterpiece comes completely fresh to the market, having remained in the same collection for over a century, and most recently, on loan for the last two decades to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.",,,,,,,,
10,The Anatomy Lecture of Dr. Nicolae Tulp,Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn,oil on canvas,"Baroque, Northern Baroque, Dutch","The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is a 1632 oil painting on canvas by Rembrandt housed in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, the Netherlands. Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is pictured explaining the musculature of the arm to medical professionals. Some of the spectators are various doctors who paid commissions to be included in the painting. The painting is signed in the top-left hand corner Rembrandt. f[ecit] 1632. This may be the first instance of Rembrandt signing a painting with his forename (in its original form) as opposed to the monogramme RHL (Rembrandt Harmenszoon of Leiden), and is thus a sign of his growing artistic confidence.
The event can be dated to 31 January 1632: the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons, of which Tulp was official City Anatomist, permitted only one public dissection a year, and the body would have to be that of an executed criminal.[1] Anatomy lessons were a social event in the 17th century, taking place in lecture rooms that were actual theatres, with students, colleagues and the general public being permitted to attend on payment of an entrance fee. The spectators are appropriately dressed for this social occasion. It is thought that the uppermost (not holding the paper) and farthest left figures were added to the picture later.[2] Every five to ten years, the Surgeon's Guild would commission a portrait by a leading portraitist of the period; Rembrandt was commissioned for this task when he was 26 years old, and newly arrived in Amsterdam. It was his first major commission in Amsterdam. Each of the men included in the portrait would have paid a certain amount of money to be included in the work, and the more central figures (in this case, Dr. Tulp) probably paid more, even twice as much. Rembrandt's anatomical portrait radically altered the conventions of the genre, by including a full length corpse in the center of the image (using Christ-like iconography) and creating not just a portrait but a dramatic Mise-en-scène. Rembrandt's image is a fiction; in a typical anatomy lesson, the surgeon would begin by opening the chest cavity and thorax because the internal organs there decay most rapidly. One person is missing: the Preparator, whose task was to prepare the body for the lesson. In the 17th century an important scientist such as Dr. Tulp would not be involved in menial and bloody work like dissection, and such tasks would be left to others. It is for this reason that the picture shows no cutting instruments. Instead we see in the lower right corner an enormous open textbook on anatomy, possibly the 1543 De humani corporis fabrica (Fabric of the Human Body) by Andreas Vesalius.
The corpse is that of the criminal Aris Kindt (alias of Adriaan Adriaanszoon), who was convicted for armed robbery and sentenced to death by hanging. He was executed earlier on the same day of the scene.[3] The face of the corpse is partially shaded,[1] a suggestion of umbra mortis (shadow of death), a technique that Rembrandt was to use frequently. The French art historian Jean-Marie Clarke points out that the navel of the corpse has the shape of a capital R and connects this observation to the fact that Rembrandt worked intensively on his signatures in 1632, using three types consecutively before settling on the final, first name form in 1633.[4] Kindt was discussed in the 1999 novel The Rings of Saturn by W. G. Sebald, and plays a si""nificant role in Laird Hunt's 2006 novel The Exquisite. In her 2014 novel, ""The Anatomy Lesson"" author and journalist Nina Siegal tells the life story of Aris Kindt, based on documents about his criminal history that she discovered in the Amsterdam city archives. Medical specialists have commented on the accuracy of muscles and tendons painted by the 26-year-old Rembrandt. It is not known where he obtained such knowledge; it is possible that he copied the details from an anatomical textbook. However, in 2006 Dutch researchers recreated the scene with a male cadaver, revealing several discrepancies of the exposed left forearm compared to that of a real corpse.[5][6] The surgically astute will notice that the origin of the exposed forearm muscles would seem to indicate that the flexor compartment originates at the lateral epicondyle, when it is, in fact, the medial epicondyle. It is the common extensor origin that originates at the lateral epicondyle. In a 2007 study, the American artist and anatomist David J. Jackowe and his colleagues demonstrated that the mysterious white cord that courses along the ulnar aspect of the cadaver's carpus and little finger, long thought to be either an ulnar nerve variant or artistic error, is most likely the ","Khan Academy, Dr. Bryan Zygmont: 
Rembrandt was neither Italian nor a part of the Renaissance. Instead, Rembrandt was born in Leiden in 1606. This place and timeHolland during the height of the expansion of the wealthy mercantile class during the middle half of the seventeenth centuryserved Rembrandt well through his long career. The Catholic Church often commissioned Italian artists at this time to undertake large-scale projects to promote religious ideology in support of the Counter-Reformation. Without the Catholic Church in Holland to commission art, Rembrandt and his fellow Dutch artists were lavishly supported by a wealthy, Protestant, and expanding middle class. This group of patrons enthusiastically commissioned works of art with their increasing discretionary income. New subjects (including group portraits) Many different types of art became popular during the Dutch Baroque period. Genre paintingssmall paintings of everyday lifewere exceptionally popular with a middle-class clientele, as were still lifes, landscapes, and prints. The majority of these kinds of art were both affordable and small enough to be easily displayed within an average home. Larger and more compositionally complicated, group portraiture also became popular in Holland during the seventeenth century. This was a mode of painting that was often placed in a public space so that the image could promote a particular organization.
Relocating to Amsterdam Although several of Rembrandts most well-known paintings are group portraitsThe Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp among othershis early education in Leiden, first at a Latin school and then later at the university, suggest that he was destined for a vocation other than art. However, by the time he was sixteen he decided he wanted to be a painter and a draughtsman. After finding quick success in Leiden during the 1620s, Rembrandt relocated to Amsterdam in 1631, a wise professional decision, as this was then one of the wealthiest and largest cities in Europe. 
A group portrait for the Amsterdam Surgeon's Guild Rembrandt van Rijn, The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp, 1632, oil on canvas, 169.5x 216.5 cm (Mauritshuis, The Hague) Rembrandt van Rijn, The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp, 1632, oil on canvas, 169.5 x 216.5 cm (Mauritshuis, The Hague) Just a year after his arrival, Rembrandt was offered the commission to complete a group portrait of the Amsterdam Surgeons Guild, an image that in time has come to be known rather simply as The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp. It is remarkable that Rembrandt received this commission as a newcomer to Amsterdam when there were other native-born artists available. Thomas de Keyser (above) and Nicolaes Pickenoy (below), for example, were older and more experienced in the realm of group portraiture. Whereas another artist may have simply recreated a previous group imageinserting new heads in place of old onesRembrandt created something new, and in doing so, completed one of the most recognizable images in the history of painting. Dr. Nicolaes Tulp was appointed praelector (like a professor or lecturer) of the Amsterdam Anatomy Guild in 1628. One of the responsibilities of this position was to deliver a yearly public lecture on some aspect of human anatomy. The lecture in 1632 occurred on 16 January, and this is the scene that Rembrandt depicts in paint in The Anatomy of Lesson of Dr. Tulp. This is a more complicated composition than it at first appears. Understandably, the focal point of the image is Dr. Tulp, the doctor who is shown displaying the flexors of the cadavers left arm. Rembrandt notes the doctors significance by showing him as the only person who wears a hat. Seven colleagues surround Dr. Tulp, and they look in a variety of directionssome gaze at the cadaver, some stare at the lecturer, and some peek directly at the viewer. Each face displays a facial expression that is deeply personal and psychological. The cadaver¡ªa recently executed thief named Adriaen Adriaenszoon¡ªlies nearly parallel t",,,,,,,,
11,L.H.O.O.Q.,Marcel Duchamp,"reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa with added mustache, goatee, and title","Dada, French","First conceived in 1919, the work is one of what Duchamp referred to as readymades, or more specifically an assisted ready-made. The readymade involves taking mundane, often utilitarian objects not generally considered to be art and transforming them, by adding to them, changing them, or (as in the case of his most famous work Fountain) simply renaming them and placing them in a gallery setting. In L.H.O.O.Q. the objet trouv¨¦ (""ound object"") is a cheap postcard reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa onto which Duchamp drew a moustache and beard in pencil and appended the title. Although many say it was pioneered by him, in 1887 Eug¨¨ne Bataille created a Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, published in Le Rire.[2] Eug¨¨ne Bataillee, La Joconde fumant la pipe, Le Rire, 1887 The name of the piece, L.H.O.O.Q., is a pun; the letters pronounced in French sound like ""le a chaud au cul"", ""She is hot in the arse"";[3] ""avoir chaud au cul"" is a vulgar expression implying that a woman has sexual restlessness. In a late interview (Schwarz 203), Duchamp gives a loose translation of L.H.O.O.Q. as ""there is fire down below"". As was the case with a number of his readymades, Duchamp made multiple versions of L.H.O.O.Q. of differing sizes and in different media throughout his career, one of which, an unmodified black and white reproduction of the Mona Lisa mounted on card, is called L.H.O.O.Q. Shaved. The masculinized female introduces the theme of gender reversal, which was popular with Duchamp, who adopted his own female pseudonym, Rrose S¨¦lavy, pronounced ""ros, c'est la vie"" (""Eros, that's life"").[4] Primary responses to L.H.O.O.Q. interpreted its meaning as being an attack on the iconic Mona Lisa and traditional art,[5] a stroke of ¨¦pater le bourgeois promoting the Dadaist ideals. According to one commentator: The creation of L.H.O.O.Q. profoundly transformed the perception of La Joconde (what the French call the painting, in contrast with the Americans and Germans, who call it the Mona Lisa). In 1919 the cult of Jocondisme was practically a secular religion of the French bourgeoisie and an important part of their self image as patrons of the arts. They regarded the painting with reverence, and Duchamp's salacious comment and defacement was a major stroke of epater le bourgeois (""reaking out"" or substantially offending the bourgeois).[6] According to Rhonda R. Shearer the apparent reproduction is in fact a copy partly modelled on Duchamp's own face. Parodies of Duchamp's parodic Mona Lisa. 

  rem","In 1919, Duchamp performed a seemingly adolescent prank using a postcard that represented the ideal of feminine beauty, Leonardo da Vinci's?Mona Lisa. He drew a mustache and goatee on her face and added the letters ""L.H.O.O.Q."" The caption combines Duchamp's gleeful sense of wit with his love of wordplay: eliding the letters in French sounds like, ""Elle a chaud au cul"" (""There is fire down below""). The image trespasses traditional boundaries of appropriation by presenting a reproduction, however tarted up, as an original work of art. The masculinized female introduces the theme of gender reversal, which was popular with Duchamp, who adopted his own female pseudonym, Rrose S¨¦lavy, pronouced ""ros, c'est la vie"" (""Eros, that's life"").?La Jocondeinstantly became his most famous readymade and a symbol for the international Dada movement, which rebelled against everything that art represented, particularly the appeal to tradition and beauty.

12,Decorative Panel,Odilon Redon,oil on canvas,"Symbolism, Expressionism","Odilon Redon (born Bertrand-Jean Redon; French: [??d??]; April 20, 1840 ¨C July 6, 1916) was a French symbolist painter, printmaker, draughtsman and pastellist. Odilon Redon was born in Bordeaux, Aquitaine, to a prosperous family. The young Bertrand-Jean Redon acquired the nickname ""dilon"" from his mother, Odile.[2] Redon started drawing as a child; and, at the age of ten, he was awarded a drawing prize at school. He began the formal study of drawing at fifteen; but, at his father's insistence, he changed to architecture. Failure to pass the entrance exams at Paris École des Beaux-Arts ended any plans for a career as an architect, although he briefly studied painting there under Jean-Léon Gérôme in 1864. (His younger brother Gaston Redon would become a noted architect.) Back in his native Bordeaux, he took up sculpting, and Rodolphe Bresdin instructed him in etching and lithography. His artistic career was interrupted in 1870 when he joined the army to serve in the Franco-Prussian War. At the end of the war, he moved to Paris and resumed working almost exclusively in charcoal and lithography. He called his visionary works, conceived in shades of black, his noirs. It was not until 1878 that his work gained any recognition with Guardian Spirit of the Waters; he published his first album of lithographs, titled Dans le Rêve, in 1879. Still, Redon remained relatively unknown until the appearance in 1884 of a cult novel by Joris-Karl Huysmans titled À rebours (Against Nature). The story featured a decadent aristocrat who collected Redon's drawings. In the 1890s pastel and oils became his favored media; he produced no more noirs after 1900. In 1899, he exhibited with the Nabis at Durand-Ruel's. Redon had a keen interest in Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture. The figure of the Buddha increasingly showed in his work. Influences of Japonism blended into his art, such as the painting The Death of the Buddha around 1899, The Buddha in 1906, Jacob and the Angel in 1905, and Vase with Japanese warrior in 1905, amongst many others.[3][4] Baron Robert de Domecy (1867¨C1946) commissioned the artist in 1899 to create 17 decorative panels for the dining room of the Ch?teau de Domecy-sur-le-Vault near Sermizelles in Burgundy. Redon had created large decorative works for private residences in the past, but his compositions for the ch?teau de Domecy in 1900¨C1901 were his most radical compositions to that point and mark the transition from ornamental to abstract painting. The landscape details do n""show a specific place or space. Only details of trees, twigs with leaves, and budding flowers in an endless horizon can be seen. The colours used are mostly yellow, grey, brown and light blue. The influence of the Japanese painting style found on folding screens by¨­bu is discernible in his choice of colours and the rectangular proportions of most of the up to 2.5 metres high panels. Fifteen of them are located today in the Mus¨¦e d'Orsay, acquisitioned in 1988.[5] Domecy also commissioned Redon to paint""rtraits of his wife and their daughter Jeanne, two of which are in the collections of the Mus¨¦e d'Orsay and the Getty Museum in California.[6][7] Most of the paintings remained in the Domecy family collection until the 1960s.[8] In 1903 Redon was awarded the Legion of Honor.[9] His popularity increased when a catalogue of etchings and lithographs was published by Andr¨¦ Mellerio in 1913; that same year, he was given the largest single representation at the New York Armory Show. Redon died on July 6, 1916. In 1923 Mellerio published Odilon Redon: Peintre Dessinateur et Graveur. An archive of Mellerio's papers is held by the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 2005 the Museum of Modern Art launched an exhibition entitled ""yond The Visible"", a comprehensive overview of Redon's work showcasing more than 100 paintings, drawings, prints and books from The Ian Woodner Family Collection. The exhibition ran from October 30, 2005 to January 23, 2006.[10] The Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland is showing a retrospective from February to May 2014.[11]
During his early years as an artist, Redon's works were described as ""a synthesis of nightmares and dreams"", as they contained dark, fantastical figures from the artist's own imagination.[12] His work represents an exploration of his internal feelings and psyche. He himself wanted to place ""the logic of the visible at the service of the invisible"".[13] A telling source of Redon's inspiration and the forces behind his works can be found in his journal A Soi-m¨ºme (To Myself). His process was explained best by himself when he said:

"" have often, as an exercise and as a sustenance, painted before an object down to the smallest accidents of its visual appearance; but the day left me sad and with an unsatiated thirst. The next day I let the other source run, that of","Redon's art had changed radically since the early 1890s. He had abandoned lithography and the charcoal of his famous Noirs in order to draw in pastel and to paint with vivid colours. It is hardly surprising that this evolution finally brought him to decorative art, a genre that preoccupied artists throughout the late 19th century. Redon was of the same generation as the Impressionists. In 1876, Monet decorated the ch?teau of his friend Ernest Hosched¨¦, whereas Renoir never stopped thinking ""ecoration"" and ""gaiety on bare walls"". Redon was, moreover, an admirer of Puvis de Chavannes. He was also very close to the young Nabi painters, who insisted that art should be part of daily life. In this, they subscribed to the theory of the writer and critic Albert Aurier: ""there are no paintings, there is only decoration"". It was thanks to an early commission that Redon started to work on large surfaces in 1900-1901, completing around fifteen panels for the ch?teau that Baron Robert de Domecy had just had built in the Yonne region. On that occasion, he wrote to his friend Albert Bonger ""I am covering the walls of a dining room with flowers, flowers of dreams, fauna of the imagination; all in large panels, treated with a bit of everything, distemper, ""aoline"", oil, even with pastel which is giving good results at the moment, a giant pastel."" In 1902, he designed a decoration for the music room of the Paris mansion of composer Ernest Chausson's widow. Then, in 1908, the Gobelins Manufactory commissioned him to do some tapestry cartoons. But the library at Fontfroide would be Redon's great decorative work.
It was during Redon's second stay at the abbey, at Easter in 1910, that he reached an agreement with Fayet to decorate the large, square room, almost ten metres by ten. Two huge panels 6.5 metres wide and 2 metres high, divided into three parts, would face each other on the side walls, with a one metre wide panel placed above the door. 
Redon was given complete freedom to choose the subject. He went back to Paris and began work on the first of the large panels, Day, returning at the end of the summer in 1910 to supervise its installation before starting work, at the abbey, on the second panel, Night. In a letter to Bonger he described the atmosphere in which the works were progressing: ""I am writing to you from beneath the vaulted ceiling of the large room that I am decorating in the old cloisters. I have brought my work with me so that I can work in situ. I find this enormously stimulating. [¡­] I have taken a""isk with the representation (still not fully defined) of a quadriga driven by one or two winged creatures, sort of flowers, in a mountainous landscape rendered in a range of luminous greys. On the opposite wall is another panel that I have sketched in black, leaving myself the option to indulge shamelessly in every imaginable fantasy. Black on a large surface is wonderful. I realise that I must not take it too far, but you only really know, you only learn while you are actually creating a work. It's the first time that I have agonised over a surface like this [¡­]. I am pursuing this project surrounded by extremely lively, happy guests, in the cheerful, bright Mediterranean sunshine. A beautiful region, not far from the landscapes C¨¦zanne and Van Gogh painted. I see it through different eyes, of course""When he had finished Day at the abbey, Redon then worked on Night, this time finishing it in Paris, and finally installing it in the autumn of 1911.

Day, Night and Silence
With their contrasting themes and subjects, the two panels can be seen as a synthesis of Redon's art. The dazzling yellow of Day, and the exuberance of the flowers at the sides, are characteristic of Redon's second period, when colour became his passion.

The quadriga, a tribute to Delacroix and to his ceiling decoration in the Apollo Gallery of the Louvre, is also a motif that regularly appears in the paintings Redon produced towards the end of his career.

Night, on the other hand, brings back shapes often presented in the Noirs of the 1870s: fallen angel, winged heads, veiled women¡­ But these visions seem more gentle, less disturbing than his earlier creatures. Redon gives the smiling, peaceful faces the features of the owners of Fontfroide and their friends: the two veiled women are Madeleine Fayet and her daughter Simone; in the will o' the wisps flitting around to the right of the tree we can recognise the profil"" of Camille Redon, Gustave Fayet and his two sons, L¨¦on and Antoine¡­ Many musicians also figu",,,,,,,,
13,Beware of Luxury,Jan Steen,oil on canvas,"Renaissance, Netherlandish, 17th century","Remarkably, given the meager living he made from art, Jan Steen was the humorist among Dutch painters. He persevered, creating nearly eight hundred pictures, most with a moral beneath the wit. A prosperous brewer's son, Steen enrolled in Leyden University in 1646, but by 1648 he was helping to found the Leyden Guild of Saint Luke. His teachers may have included Nikolaus Kn¨¹pfer. Steen was not one to stay put; he lived in The Hague; Haarlem; Leyden, where he ran a tavern; and Delft, where he leased a brewery. He married Jan van Goyen's daughter. Steen dated few paintings and frequently varied hi""style. His range included riotous tavern scenes and gentle lessons. His commonplace interiors with ordinary people look straight forward, but he usually included a moral, sometimes as an inscription. Allusions to old proverbs, emblems, literature, and the theater abound. A lifelong Catholic, he painted more than sixty religious pictures, usually treating them like incidents in seventeenth-century Holland and not holding back on the humanity or humor. Steen's skill in rendering light and texture rank him with Gerard ter Borch. He frequently portrayed himself in pictures - not necessarily flatteringly. The Dutch call a lively, untidy home a ""Jan Steen household"". 

Jan Steen arranges the various actors as though on a theatre stage. The gentle depth of the composition is based on a triangle, with the magnificently dressed young woman at its top point. Her clothing and seductive look identify her as a ¡°loose-living¡± girl. She, however, is not the focus of the scene; that is provided by the lady of the house, who has fallen asleep at the table on the left. Her ¡°absence¡± has resulted in the rest of the story: the dog is finishing the meat pie that was served on the table, one of the children is filching something from the cabin","he picture teems with allusions to intemperance and its pernicious consequences. Accordingly, the central fig ures of the licentious couple are complemented by the neglectful sleeping maidser vant, the thieving child, the discarded hat and cards (metaphors of indulgence), the roses cast before the swine, the foolish ape causing time to stand still, and the beggar's basket suspended from the ceiling, a perti nent reminder of the outcome of such riotous living.1 But the appearance of a prominent figure in the composition, the Quaker studiously absorbed in his reading, has not been explained.2 Why does Steen allow this sober figure to intrude on the general tenor of licentiousness that permeates the painting? Through an investigation of seven teenth-century accounts of Quaker activity in Holland, a clearer picture of the Quaker persona emerges, and Steen's inclusion of this figure takes on a topical satric resonance.",,,,,,,,
14,"Chinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas",Donald Judd,"Concrete, sculpture",Minimalism,"The Chinati Foundation/La Fundación Chinati is a contemporary art museum based upon the ideas of its founder, Donald Judd. The specific intention of Chinati is to preserve and present to the public permanent large-scale installations by a limited number of artists. The emphasis is on works in which art and the surrounding landscape are inextricably linked. As Judd wrote in the foundation's catalogue: It takes a great deal of time and thought to install work carefully. This should not always be thrown away. Most art is fragile and some should be placed and never moved again. Somewhere a portion of contemporary art has to exist as an example of what the art and its context were meant to be. Somewhere, just as the platinum-iridium meter guarantees the tape measure, a strict measure must exist for the art of this time and place. The Chinati Foundation is located on 340 acres of land on the site of former Fort D.A. Russell in Marfa, Texas. Construction and installation at the site began in 1979 with initial assistance from the Dia Art Foundation in New York. The Chinati Foundation opened to the public in 1986 as an independent, non-profit, publicly funded institution. Chinati was originally conceived to exhibit the work of Donald Judd, John Chamberlain and Dan Flavin. The collection was expanded and now includes 15 outdoor concrete works by Donald Judd, 100 aluminum works by Judd housed in two converted artillery sheds, 25 sculptures by John Chamberlain, an installation by Dan Flavin occupying six former army barracks, and works by Carl Andre, Ing¨®lfur Arnarsson, Roni Horn, Ilya Kabakov, Richard Long, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, David Rabinowitch, and John Wesley. Each artist's work is installed in a separate building on the museum's grounds. Temporary exhibitions feature modern and contemporary art of diverse media. The Chinati Foundation sponsors art and education programs, establishing close links to the local community and other cultural institutions and universities in the United States and abroad. Started by Judd, Chinati's Artists in Residence Program provides artists from around the world an opportunity to devel"" and exhibit their work in a stimulating environment. Chinati's Internship Program offers students from a variety of disciplines hands-on museum experience. Each summer the museum hosts art classes for local students. Chinati produces an annual newsletter in English and Spanish, and every October, Chinati hosts a festive annual weekend focused on the museum's collection and programs.

The art and architecture of the past that we know is that which remains. The best is that which remains where it was painted, placed or built. Most of the art of the past that could be moved was taken by conquerors. Almost all recent art is conquered as soon as it's made, since it's first shown for sale and once sold is exhibited as foreign in the alien museums. The public has no idea of art other than that it is something portable that can be bought. There is no constructive effort; there is no cooperative effort. This situation is primitive in relation to a few earlier and better times.

Art and architecture - all the arts - do not have to exist in isolation, as they do now. This fault is very much a key to the present society. Architecture is nearly gone, but it, art, all of the arts, in fact all parts of the society, have to be rejoined, and joined more than they have ever been. This would be democratic in a good sense, unlike the present increasing fragmentation into separate but equal categories, equal within the arts, but inferior to the powerful bureaucracies.

Jose Ortega Y Gasset wrote: ""Pero 10 mas grave en esa aberracion intelectualista que significa la beateria de la cultura no es eso, sino que consiste en presentar al hombre la cultura, el ensimismamiento, el pensamiento, como una gracia 0 joya que este debe anadir a su vida, por tanto, como algo que se halla por 10 pronto fuera de ella, como si existiese un vivir sin cultura y sin pensar, como si fuese posible vivir sin ensimismarse. Con 10 cual se colocaba a los hombres - como ante el escaparate de una joyeria - en la opcion de adquirir la cultura 0 prescindir de ella. Y, claro esta, ante parejo dilema, a 10 largo de estos anos que estamos vivien do, los hombres no han vacilado, sino que han resuelto ensayar a fondo esto ultimo e intentan rehuir toto ensimismamiento y entregarse a la plena alteracion.

""But the most dangerous aspect of the intellectual aberration that this 'bigotry of culture' signifies is not this; it consists in presenting culture, withdrawal into one's self, thought, as a grace or jewel that man is to add to his life, hence as something that provisionally lies outside of his life and as if there were life without culture and thought - as if it were possible to live without withdrawing into one's self. Men were set, as it were, before a jeweler's window - were given the choice of acquiring culture or doing without it. And it is clear that, faced with such a dilemma, during the years we are now living through men have not hesitated, but have resolved to explore the second alternative to its limits and are seeking to flee from all abstraction and to give themselves up to the full alteration.""

Judd started using unpainted plywood in the early 1970s,[16] a material the artist embraced for its durable structural qualities, which enabled him to expand the size of his works while avoiding the problem of bending or buckling. Plywood had been the staple of his art earlier, but never unpainted.[17] He later began using Cor-ten steel in the 1980s for a small number of large-scale outdoor pieces, and by 1989 would create single and multi-part works with the material. The Cor-ten works are unique in that they are the only works the artist fabricated in Marfa. The artist began working with enamel on aluminum in 1984, when he commissioned Lehni AG in Switzerland to construct works by bending and riveting thin sheets of the material, a process Judd previously used to create furniture. These pieces were initially created for a temporary outdoor exhibition in Merian Park outside Basel.[citation needed] Judd would continue to produce pieces using these techniques through the early 1990s. Judd¡¯s work with enamel on aluminum greatly expanded his palette of colors, which had previously been restricted to the colors of anodized metal and Plexiglas, and led to the use of more than two colors in an individual artwork. Combining a wide range of colors, he used the material to create five large-scale floor pieces and many horizontal wall works in unique variations of color and size.[18][19] Judd¡¯s only known work in granite, an untitled Sierra White granite floor piece from 1978, m""ures 49 x 98 x 98"". The structure is composed of two vertical slabs that rest on the floor, to which the bottom component is c","The fifteen concrete works by Donald Judd that run along the border of Chinati's property were the first works to be installed at the museum and were cast and assembled on the site over a four-year period, from 1980 through 1984. The individual units that comprise each work have the same measurements of 2.5 x 2.5 x 5 meters, and are made from concrete slabs that are each 25 centimeters thick. Funding for the project was provided by the Dia Art Foundation.

In the late 1970s, when Donald Judd started work on his most ambi?tious project, which he later named the Chinati Foundation, he was not only rethinking the concept of the museum as such, he was also em?barking on his two most ambitious works of art, which were to be the culmination of his artistic career. The Chinati Foundation project was be?gun by Judd in 1978-79 in Marfa, Texas, where he had lived for the past five years and where he had al?ready turned two former aircraft hangars and the land around them into his own private residence. This property is a complete microcosm in its own right, whichlike a monastery has all of lifes essentials, from an excellent library to a chicken coop. Unusually, however, it also has an outstanding art collectionpredomi­nantly works by Judd himselfgen­erously laid out and interspersed in among everyday objects such as dining table, bed, armchair, music system. Judd was exploring the con­nection between art and life: art be­came the heart of the household and each piece was placed with as much care as he would expect from a museum display. The fact is that the Mansana de Chinatito give it its Hispanic nameis a mansion aspir­ing to the status of a museum. Judd was well aware of this, and made all the relevant decisions with an eye to the future. While he was still alive, his creation functioned as a private home; now it works as a do­mestic museum, where the public can view an impressive collection of early pieces by Judd. Muchalthough not allof the Mansana was already finished when the possibility arose, through the Dia Art Foundation, of creating a new kind of museum in Marfa, a museum which would be able to ac­commodate large-scale works made specifically for it. This was the an­swer to Judds long-cherished dream of creating something that exceeded the potential of conventional exhibi­tion practices and demanded more of the artist than a single work. Judd had been waiting for just such a challenge and the Dia Art Founda­tion was prepared to provide the finances needed to realize some­thing truly great. Both Dia and Judd shared ideals that were rooted in the Renaissance, ideals that they were not afraid to measure themselves against, be it on a philanthropic or an artistic level.

For Judd it was important that his art should relate to the architecture of the museum so that eachart and architecturewould both hold its own and underpin the other. He had so often been dissatisfied with the exhibition spaces in art museums, regarding them as largely unsuited to showing contemporary art. How­ever, his aim in Marfa was more than simply to create suitable spaceshis ultimate aim was to unite art, architecture, and nature in an embodiment of his own philo­sophical outlook, which sought to avoid fragmentation and to promote coherence. These had been the pa­rameters for the Chinati project as a whole,1 which was to include instal­lations by Dan Flavin and John Chamberlain as well as work by Judd himself. Its important to re­member that the aim was not to cre­ate a single-artist museum, but that the intention was that works by dif­ferent artists should enter into dia­logue with each other. Initially Judd wanted to restrict the work to these three artists alone, since he felt that it was already hard enough to cre­ate the right conditions for installa­tions by even just three artists and to take care of their work appropriate­ly in the long term. However, he was always interested in including work by additional artists in the collec­tion, and did so later on. After the break with the Dia Art Foundation in 1987, the collection was expanded to include work by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, Ilya Kabakov, Carl Andre, Ingolfur Arnarsson, Roni Horn, Richard Long, and John Wesley. In this text, however, I will concen­trate entirely on the work of Donald Judd, specifically the two ensembles that he conceived for the Chinati Foundation. The first of these is the series of 15 multi-part works, made from concrete and placed outside in an open field (ill.3); the second is the group of 100 aluminum boxes which now occupy two large spaces, formerly gunsheds (ill. 17, p. 55). The sheer size of these en­sembles means that each was a huge undertaking in terms of its con­ception, realization, and financial backing, and each took between four and six years to complete. Judd had never made anything even re­motely as large and these projects posed unusual challenges in terms of their design and production. Al­though they are similar in sizeone group consists of 60 units, the other has 100 units, and took much the same length of time to produce, hav­ing been started at the same time they underwent very different pro­duction processes, which I will presently describe. They cast an in­teresting light on Judds working methods in circumstances that were a mixture of challenging and not far short of ideal. The design for the 15 concrete pieces evolved in stages. Judd put his ideas down on paper in 84 drawings, with the result that we are now in the position to follow his thinking stage by stage and to un­derstand the relevant chronology since all but a few of the drawings are dated. When the first contract was agreed with the Dia Art Founda­tion in spring 1979, there was still talk of certain large-scale outdoor sculptures, whose nature and ma­terials were yet to be determined by the artist. Adobe and concrete were aired as possibilities. In addi­tion, the agreement also states that the location for these works was yet to be identified and that it was as­sumed that one work would be real­ized per year, with the contract to run for five years. Clearly much was still to be decided. Judds first handwritten note regard­ing this project is dated August 1980 (ill. 1), in other words, roughly one year after the contract had first been agreed. However, in the mean­time Judd had identified the location that the works were to be made for. He described it in this note as about 100 feet off Northsouth road at North; this is a reference to a dirt track that runs along the outer edge of the Chinati property. The chosen site runs parallel to this track, and was the only flat land in this otherwise slightly sloping site. The note states that the sculptures are to be placed in a straight line, as far as possible exactly on the north-south line of longitude, with every work centered precisely on this axis and equidistant from its neighbors. In the case of the works with a triangular configuration, one side was to coincide precisely with the east-west axis. An additional note (ill. 2) records the length of the site as 3,210 feet or 978 meters, of which 197 feet (60 meters) is taken up by an embankment, which leaves 3,094 feet or 942 meters that can be used. Divided by 15clearly the decision had been made that this should be the number of worksthis allows a distance of 63 meters be­tween the works, which Judd round­ed down to 60. So it had now been decided that there should be a dis­tance of 60 meters from the center of one to the center of the next of the 15 concrete works, regardless of their individual dimensions or the number of parts they consisted of; furthermore it had been decided that they should be placed north-south and east-west where necessary. Having determined these coordi­nates, Judd now had an underlying order which allowed him consider­able freedom in the design of the in­dividual pieces. On the first sheet of sketches and notes, made in August 1980, there are already several indications of triangular structures. Three rectangu­lar volumes form a triangle; the tips of the trianglewhich make up the basic shapeextend beyond the rectangles. The question of the dis­tances between the elements has not been fixed yeteither 2.5 or 2 me­tersbut it already seems to have been decided that the rectangles are positioned outside the triangle, with one long edge lying along the side of the triangle. Halfway down the note, on one side, there are two small rectangles side-by-side, with the words first and then fol­lowed by a triangle. This line has been scored through and replaced with a note that the first element should be a triangle. The third sheet (ill. 4) shows the same two configu­rations again, although with the two- part figure on the left and the trian­gle on the right, as they were later realized. The distances between the elements are noted as 1.25 and 2.5 meters, as in the finished work. The distance from center to center is marked here as 200 feet or 70 me­ters, but there is also a number 603 under the 70, even if it is upside- down. The elements themselves are marked as 5 meters long and 2.5 meters deep. These measurements seem to have been decided very early on, for there is only one isolat­ed drawing with different measure­ments, and this is clearly not rele­vant to Judds thinking as a whole. It is interesting that Judd chose to work here with the metric systemeven though he measured his concurrent aluminum pieces in inches. The late 1970s and early 80s was a transi­tional phase for the artist; although he was using both systems of mea?surement at this time, he was veer?ing toward the metrical system, which is broadly speaking a simpler system that makes it easier to calcu?late relationships. With just a few exceptions¡ªsuch as the so-called stacks and progressions, which are based on measurements established in the 1960s¡ªfrom the early 1980s onwards Judd calculated his works, particularly any new pieces, in me?ters and centimeters. The concrete works at the Chinati Foundation are the first pieces of this size to b",,,,,,,,
15,Dance,Henri Mattise,oil on canvas,"Impressionism, fauvism, color theory, light ","French artist, known for both his use of colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship. He was a draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but is known primarily as a painter.[1] Matisse is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Marcel Duchamp, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts throughout the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture.[2][3][4][5] Although he was initially labelled a Fauve (wild beast), by the 1920s he was increasingly hailed as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting.[6] His mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in modern art.[7] Fauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910. The movement as such lasted only a few years, 1904¨C1908, and had three exhibitions.[19][20] The leaders of the movement were Matisse and Andr¨¦ Derain.[19] Matisse's first solo exhibition was at Ambroise Vollard's gallery in 1904,[16] without much success. His fondness for bright and expressive colour became more pronounced after he spent the summer of 1904 painting in St. Tropez with the neo-Impressionists Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross.[15] In that year he painted the most important of his works in the neo-Impressionist style, Luxe, Calme et Volupt¨¦.[15] In 1905 he travelled southwards again to work with Andr¨¦ Derain at Collioure. His paintings of this period are characterised by flat shapes and controlled lines, using pointillism in""ss rigorous way than before. Matisse and a group of artists now known as ""Fauves"" exhibited together in a room at the Salon d'Automne in 1905. The paintings expressed emotion with wild, often dissonant colours, without regard for the subject's natural colours. Matisse showed Open Window and Woman with the Hat at the Salon. Critic Louis Vauxcelles described the work with the phrase ""Donatello parmi les fauves!"" (Donatello among the wild beasts), referring to a Renaissance-type sculpture that shared the room with them.[21] His comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in Gil Blas, a daily newspaper, and passed into popular usage.[19][21] The exhibition garnered harsh criticism¡ª"" pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public"", said the critic Camille Mauclair¡ªbut also some favourable attention.[21] When the painting that was singled out for special condemnation, Matisse's Woman with a Hat, was bought by Gertrude and Leo Stein, the embattled artist's morale improved considerably.[21] Les toits de Collioure, 1905, oil on canvas, The Hermitage, St. Petersburg, Russia Matisse was recognised as a leader of the Fauves, along with Andr¨¦ Derain; the two were friendly rivals, each with his own followers. Other members were Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, and Maurice de Vlaminck. The Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau (1826¨C1898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the ?cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions. In 1907 Guillaume Apollinaire, commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, wrote, ""are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.""[22] But Matisse's work of the time also encountered vehement criticism, and it was difficult for him to provide for his family.[11] His painting Nu bleu (1907) was burned in effigy at the Armory Show in Chicago in 1913.[23] The decline of the Fauvist movement after 1906 did not affect the career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in Montparnasse, even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict bourgeois work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to Algeria in 1906 studying African art and Primitivism. After viewing a large exhibition of Islamic art in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited Morocco in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in Tangiers he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour.[24][25][26] The effect on Matisse's art was a new boldness in the use of intense, unmodulated colour, as in L'Atelier Rouge (1911).[15] He created one of his major works La Danse specially for Shchukin as part of a two painting commission, the other painting being Music, 1910. An earlier version of La Danse (1909) is in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York City. 

Dance (La Danse) refers to either of two related paintings made by Henri Matisse between 1909 and 1910. The first, preliminary version is Matisse's study for the second version. The composition or arrangement of dancing figures is reminiscent of Blake's watercolour ""Oberon, Titania and Puck with fairies dancing"" from 1786.[1]

Dance (I)[edit] In March 1909, Matisse painted a preliminary version of this work, known as Dance (I).[2] It was a compositional study and uses paler colors and less detail.[3] The painting was highly regarded by the artist who once called it ""the overpowering climax of luminosity""; it is also featured in the background of Matisse's La Danse with Nasturtiums (1912). It was donated by Nelson A. Rockefeller in honor of Alfred H. Barr, Jr. to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Until the October Revolution of 1917, this painting hung together with Music on the staircase of Shchukin's Moscow mansion.[4] The painting shows fi","MOMA: A monumental image of joy and energy, Dance is also strikingly daring. Matisse made the painting while preparing a decorative commission for the Moscow collector Sergei Shchukin, whose final version of the scene, Dance (II), was shown in Paris in 1910. Nearly identical in composition to this work, its simplifications of the human body were attacked as inept or willfully crude. Also noted was the work's radical visual flatness: the elimination of perspective and foreshortening that makes nearer and farther figures the same size, and the sky a plane of blue. This is true, as well, of the first version. Here, the figure at the left moves purposefully; the strength of her body is emphasized by the sweeping unbroken contour from her rear foot up to her breast. The other dancers seem so light they nearly float. The woman at the far right is barely sketched in, her foot dissolving in runny paint as she reels backward. The arm of the dancer to her left literally stretches as it reaches toward the leader's hand, where momentum has broken the circle. The dancers' speed is barely contained by the edges of the canvas. Dance (II) is more intense in color than this first version, and the dancers' bodies¡ªthere deep red¡ªare more sinewy and energetic. In whatever canvas they appear, these are no ordinary dancers, but mythical creatures in a timeless landscape. Dance, Matisse once said, meant ""fe and rhythm.""

Khan Academy: In 1909 Matisse received an important commission. An extremely wealthy Russian industrialist named Sergei Shchukin asked Matisse for three large scale canvases to decorate the spiral staircase of his mansion, the Trubetskoy Palace, in Moscow. The large and well loved painting, Dance I at MoMA, is somewhat disingenously titled. Although it is full scale and in oil, Matisse did not consider it more than a preparatory sketch. Yet a comparison between the initial and final versions is instructive. Matisse borrowed the motif from the back of the 1905-06 painting Bonheur de Vivre, although he has removed one dancer. In Dance I, the figures express the light pleasure and joy that was so much a part of the earlier Fauve masterpiece. The figures are drawn loosely, with almost no interior definition. They have been likened to bean bag dolls because of their formless and unrestricted movements. The bodies certainly dont seem to be restrained by way. But dont let this childlike spontaneity fool you. Matisse works very hard to make his paintings seem effortless. Imagine for a moment, that instead of this childlike style, Matisse had decided to render this figures with the frozen density of Jacques Louis David. Would the sense of pure joy, the sense of play have been as well expressed? Matisse has done something that is actually very difficult. He has unlearned the lessons of representation so that he can create an image where form matches content. The dancers inhabit a brilliant blue and green field. But what exactly does the green represent? Many people would quickly reply, a grassy hilltop. Okay, but what then is the blue intended to represent? If I were lecturing at MoMA, as I often do, many listeners would offer that the blue is the sky that rises above the hill. But others in my group might begin to look frustrated. One might then say, thats not what I see, the blue is really water moving back into the distance. Henri Matisse, detail Dance I, 1909, oil on canvas, 259.7 x 390 cm (Museum of Modern Art, New York City) What Matisse has done here, even in seemingly simple rendering, is use spatial ambiguity to explore one of the key issues in modern painting, the conflict between the illusion of depth and an acknowledgment of the flatness of the canvas. One final point here, did you notice the break in the circle? The hands of the two front dancers are parted. Matisse has been careful to allow this break only where it overlaps the knee so as not to interrupt the continuity of the color. Why do this? The part is often interpreted in two ways, as a source of tension that requires resolution or, as an invitation to us the viewer to join in, after all, the break is at the point closest to our position. Henri Matisse, Dance, 1910, oil on canvas, 260 x 291 cm (The Hermitage, St. Petersburg) The final version of Dance has a very different emotional character. It has been described as forbidding, menacing, tribal, ritualistic, even demonic. Drum beats almost seem to be heard as the simple pleasure of the original is overwhelmed. What causes these dramatic changes in mood? Beyond the color shift, which is pretty obvious, the figures of the 1910 canvas are drawn with more interior line, line which often suggests tension and physical power. See for instance, the back left figure. Another more subtle change occurs where the two back figures touch the ground. In the 1909 canvas, the green reaches up to the feet of the two back most dancers, in the 1910 canvas, something else happens, the green seems to compress under the dancer¡¯s weight. This subtle change creates either a sense of lightness or a sense of weight and contributes to the way we perceive each painting. So be careful before concludi",,,,,,,,
16,Portrait of Bindo Altoviti,Raphaello Sanzio da Urbino,oil on canvas,"High Renaissance, Italian, Italian Renaissance ","The Portrait of Bindo Altoviti is a painting finished around 1515 by the Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael. It is housed in the National Gallery of Art of Washington, D.C., United States. Bindo Altoviti was a rich banker born in Rome in 1491, but of Florentine origin. He was a cultured man who liked the arts. The graceful, almost effeminate position of the subject along with the heavy contrast between light and shadow are atypical of Raphael's work, particularly of his portraits of men, demonstrating the artist's experimentation with different styles and forms in his later Roman period. The influence of the works of Leonardo, which Raphael studied astutely during this period of his career, is strikingly evident in this particular piece. The painting was a property of Altoviti¡¯s descendants until 1808, when it was sold to Ludwig I of Bavaria. It remained at the Alte Pinakothek until 1936, when, after many debates about its attribution, the painting was lured out of Nazi Germany by ""anny English dealers"".[1] Acquired by Samuel Henry Kress, the portrait subsequently became property of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.. A bronze bust of Altoviti by Benvenuto Cellini is exhibited in Boston at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.[2]]","This arresting image was thought in the nineteenth century to be a Raphael self-portrait. However, we know today that this handsome young man was Bindo Altoviti, a wealthy Florentine banker and friend of the artist in Rome. He turns in a dramatic, almost theatrical, way to fix the eye of the viewer. Perhaps one viewer in particular was meant to receive his captivating look: Bindo's wife Fiammetta Soderini. Renaissance poets and courtiers were unanimous in believing that a person first fell in love through the eyes. They were called the ""guides of love,"" which could ""reveal the passion within more effectively than the tongue itself, or letter, or messengers."" Bindo's flushed cheeks contribute to the impression of passion, and a ring is prominent on the hand he holds above his heart. The robe slipping from his shoulder reveals a bare nape caressed by soft curls. Their golden color would have underscored the nobility and purity of his love. Bindo and Fiammetta, daughter of a prominent Florentine family, were married in 1511, when Bindo would have been about twenty. The couple had six children, but Fiammetta continued to live in Florence while Bindo's business with the papal court required his presence in Rome. This portrait, which apparently hung in the couple's home in Florence, would have provided Fiammetta with a vivid reminder of her absent husband. It remained in the Altoviti family for nearly three hundred years.",,,,,,,,
17,The Harlequin's Carnival,Joan Mir¨®,oil on canvas,Surrealism,"The Harlequin's Carnival (Spanish: Carnaval d'Arlequin) is an oil painting rendered by Joan Miró between 1924 and 1925. It is one of the most outstanding surrealist paintings of the artist, and it is preserved in the AlbrightKnox Art Gallery, Buffalo.[1] Created between 1924 and 1925, Harlequins Carnival is one of Joan Mirós best-known pieces. Harlequin is the name of a well-known Italian comic theater character that is generally identified by his checkered costume. The carnival in the title of the painting may refer to Mardi Gras, the celebration that occurs before the fasting of Lent begins. In 1924 poet André Breton formed the Surrealist movement. Around the time of the groups formation Miró started to paint in the surrealist style. Surrealism focused on dreams and the subconscious as artistic material, and Miró was able to draw from these ideas. He painted the subconscious, but also his own life experiences and memories. To combine these two sources he draws on his imagination to create magical elements in his paintings. This can even be seen in his early work, for instance in his 1922 detailist painting The Farm. This specific painting is centered on a harlequin at a carnival. Although the harlequin resembles a guitar, he still retains some of his harlequin characteristics such as a checkered costume, a mustache, an admiral¡¯s hat, and a pipe. The harlequin in this painting is sad, which could be due to the hole in his stomach. This detail may refer to Mir¨®¡¯s personal life experiences, because at this point in his life he did not have much money for food and was on the brink of starvation. This is a painting of a celebration; all the characters seem to be happy due to the fact they are playing, singing, and dancing. Some of the objects in the painting are anthropomorphized, and some seem to be moving and dancing as well. One example is the ladder to the left of the painting, which has an ear and an eye (Albright-Knox Art Gallery). According to Mir¨®, the ladder is a symbol of flight, evasion, and elevation. The green sphere to the right of the painting represents the globe because Mir¨®, according to him, was obsessed with the idea of ¡°conquering the world¡± (Albright-Knox Art Galler","Carnival of Harlequin is one of Joan Mir¨®'s best-known works. Harlequin was a common theater character who was usually the victim of unrequited love and frequently played the guitar. In this painting he is a guitar, with the diamond-patterned shirt associated with the character, along with other traditional features like the mustache, beard, admiral's hat, and pipe. He looks sad, perhaps because of the hole in his stomach, and Mir¨® did have financial constraints at the time¡ªhe remembered sharing radishes for dinner with a friend because it was all he had. It is thought that the title of the Gallery's painting refers to Mardi Gras, the celebration that begins the fasting of Lent. Other than Harlequin, it seems very joyous, with all kinds of hybrid creatures playing, singing, dancing, and celebrating. Some of the forms are anthropomorphized objects¡ªfor example, the ladder has an ear and an eye. Mir¨® explained some of the imagery in 1978: ""e canvas certain elements appear that will be repeated later in other works: the ladder, an element of flight and evasion, but also of elevation; animals, and above all, insects, which I have always found very interesting; the dark sphere that appears to the right is a representation of the globe, because in those days I was obsessed with one idea: 'I must conquer the world!;' the cat, who was always by my side as I painted. The black triangle that appears in the window represents the Eiffel Tower. I tried to deepen the magical side of things."""" exp",,,,,,,,
18,"Book of Kells, folio 34r (Chi Rho)",N/A,illuminated manuscript on paper folios,"illuminated manuscript, medieval, Christian, religious, symbolic","The Chi Rho is one of the earliest forms of christogram, and is used by some Christians. It is formed by superimposing the first two (capital) letters chi and rho (¦¶¦±) of the Greek word ""¦©¦²¦³¦¯¦²""istos = Christ in such a way to produce the monogram.[2] Although not technically a Christian cross, the Chi-Rho invokes the authority of Jesus, as well as symbolising his status as the Christ.[3]

The Book of Kells (Irish: Leabhar Cheanannais; Dublin, Trinity College Library, MS A. I. [58], sometimes known as the Book of Columba) is an illuminated manuscript Gospel book in Latin, containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables. It was created in a Columban monastery in Ireland or may have had contributions from various Columban institutions from both Britain and Ireland. It is believed to have been created c. 800. The text of the Gospels is largely drawn from the Vulgate, although it also includes several passages drawn from the earlier versions of the Bible known as the Vetus Latina. It is a masterwork of Western calligraphy and represents the pinnacle of Insular illumination. It is also widely regarded as Ireland's finest national treasure. The illustrations and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass that of other Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, together with Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations. The manuscript today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, has been bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum, and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest extension of the anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text itself appears to be the work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink, and the colours used were derived from a wide range of substances, many of which were imports from distant lands. The manuscript takes its name from the Abbey of Kells, which was its home for centuries. Today, it is on permanent display at Trinity College Library, Dublin. The Library usually displays two of the current four volumes at a time, one showing a major illustration and the other showing typical text pages, and the entire manuscript can be viewed on the Library's Digital Collections Repository. The Book of Kells is one of the finest and most famous of a group of manuscripts in what is known as the Insular style, produced from the late 6th through the early 9th centuries in monasteries in Ireland, Scotland and England and in continental monasteries with Hiberno-Scottish or Anglo-Saxon foundations.[1] These manuscripts include the Cathach of St. Columba, the Ambrosiana Orosius, fragmentary Gospel in the Durham Dean and Chapter Library (all from the early 7th century), and the Book of Durrow (from the second half of the 7th century). From the early 8th century come the Durham Gospels, the Echternach Gospels, the Lindisfarne Gospels (see illustration at right), and the Lichfield Gospels. Among others, the St. Gall Gospel Book belongs to the late 8th century and the Book of Armagh (dated to 807809) to the early 9th century.[2] Scholars place these manuscripts together based on similarities in artistic style, script, and textual traditions. The fully developed style of the ornamentation of the Book of Kells places it late in this series, either from the late 8th or early 9th century. The Book of Kells follows many of the iconographic and stylistic traditions found in these earlier manuscripts. For example, the form of the decorated letters found in the incipit pages for the Gospels is surprisingly consistent in Insular Gospels. Compare, for example, the incipit pages of the Gospel of Matthew in the Lindisfarne Gospels and in the Book of Kells, both of which feature intricate decorative knot work patterns inside the outlines formed by the enlarged initial letters of the text. (For a more complete list of related manuscripts, see: List of Hiberno-Saxon illustrated manuscripts).[3] The name Book of Kells is derived from the Abbey of Kells in Kells, County Meath, which was its home for much of the medieval period. The manuscript's date and place of production have been the subject of considerable debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have been created in the time of Columba,[4] possibly even as the work of his own hands. This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds: most evidence points to a composition date c. 800,[5] long after St. Columba's death in 597. The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Iona, which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland.[6] There is another tradition, with some traction among Irish scholars, that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint's death.[7] There are at least five competing theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the book, or perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona, then brought to Kells, where the illuminations were perhaps added, and never finished. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona.[8] Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells. Fourth, it may have been produced in the north of England, perhaps at Lindisfarne, then brought to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, it may have been the product of an unknown monastery in Pictish Scotland, though there is no actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscr""pt from Pictland.[9] Although the question of the exact location of the book's production will probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted.[1] Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona. Kells Abbey was plundered and pillaged by Vikings many times in the 10th century, and how the book survived is not known.[10] The earliest historical reference to the book, and indeed to the book's presence at Kells, can be found in a 1007 entry in the Annals of Ulster. This entry records that ""the great Gospel of Columkille, (Columba)[11] the chief relic of the Western World, was wickedly stolen during the night from the western sacristy of the great stone church at Cenannas on account of its wrought shrine"".[1][12] The manuscript was recovered a few months later¡ªminus its golden and bejewelled cover¡ª""der a sod"".[13] It is generally assumed that the ""great Gospel of Columkille"" is the Book of Kells.[14] If this is correct, then the book was in Kells by 1007 and had been there long enough for thieves to learn of its presence. The force of ripping the manuscript free from its cover may account for the folios missing from the beginning and end of the Book of Kells. The description in the Annals of the book as ""of Columkille""that is, having belonged to, and perhaps being made by Columbasuggests that the book was believed at that time to have been made on Iona.[15] Regardless, the book was certainly at Kells in the 12th century, when land charters pertaining to the Abbey of Kells were copied onto some of its blank pages. The practice of copying of charters into important books was widespread in the medieval period, and such inscriptions in the Book of Kells provide concrete evidence about its location at the time.[1] The Abbey of Kells was dissolved due to the ecclesiastical reforms of the 12th century. The abbey church was converted to a parish church in which the Book of Kells remained. The Book of Kells contains the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel passages.[27] Today, it consists of 340 vellum leaves, or folios. The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolios, which are folded in half to form two folios. The bifolios are nested inside of each other and sewn together to form gatherings called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire. The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires. There are between four and twelve folios (two to six bifolios) per quire; the folios are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some folios are single sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The folios had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolios were folded. Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages.[20] The vellum is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven thickness, with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent. The book's current dimensions are 330 by 250 mm. Originally, the folios were of no standard size, but they were cropped to the current size during a 19th-century rebinding. The text area is approximately 250 by 170 mm. Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text.[20] The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age, though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing. The book must have been the product of a major scriptorium over several years, yet was apparently never finished, the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline. It is believed that some 30 folios of the original manuscript have been lost over the centuries.[20] Ussher counted 344 folios in 1621, but several leaves had already been lost by then. The overall estimate is based on gaps in the text and the absence of certain key illustrations. The extant book contains preliminary matter, the complete text of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and the Gospel of John through John 17:13. The remainder of John and an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen early in the 11th century. The remaining preliminary matter consists of two fragmentary lists of Hebrew names contained in the Gospels, Breves causae (Gospel summaries), Argumenta (short biographies of the Evangelists), and Eusebian canon tables. It is probable that, like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh, part of the lost preliminary material included the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus I beginning Novum opus, in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation. It is also possible, though less likely, that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus, in which he explains the use of the canon tables.[28] Of all the insular Gospels, only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter.


Folio 5r contains a page of the Eusebian Canons.
There are two fragments of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted at the end of the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.[29]

The first list fragment is followed by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables in such a way as to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.[28]


Folio 19 contains the beginning of the Breves causae of Luke.
The Breves causae and Argumenta belong to a pre-Vulgate tradition of manuscripts. The Breves causae are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are not used on the text pages of the Gospels. It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations and would have been difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text. The Argumenta are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The Breves causae and Argumenta are arranged in a strange order: first come the Breves causae and Argumenta for Matthew, followed by the Breves and Argumenta for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the Argumenta of both Luke and John, followed by their Breves causae. This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow, although in the latter instance, the misplaced sections appear at the very end of the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary.[28] In other insular manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Book of Armagh, and the Echternach Gospels, each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it.[30] The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the Breves causae and Argumenta found in Durrow led scholar T. K. Abbott to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand.

Text and script[edit]
The Book of Kells contains the text of the four Gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.


Folio 309r contains text from the Gospel of John written in Insular majuscule by the scribe known as Hand B.
The manuscript is written primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Fran?oise Henry identified at least three scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C.[31] Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 through the end of the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West.[31] Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.[32]


Luke's genealogy of Jesus (extends over three pages)
Errors and deviations[edit]
There are a number of differences between the text and the accepted Gospels. In the genealogy of Jesus, which starts at Luke 3:23, Kells names an extra ancestor.[33]

Matthew 10:34b The canonised Bible reads ""I came not to send peace, but a sword,"" but the manuscript reads gaudium (""joy"") where it should read gladium (""sword"") and so translates as ""I came not [only] to send peace, but joy.""[34]

The lavishly decorated opening page of the Gospel according to John in the Book of Kells had been deciphered by George Bain as: ""In principio erat verbum verum""[35] [In the beginning was the True Word]. Therefore, the Incipit is a free translation into Latin of the Greek original ¦Ë¦Ï¦Ã¦Ï? rather than a mere copy of the Roman version.

Decoration[
The text is accompanied by many full-page miniatures, while smaller painted decorations appear throughout the text in unprecedented quantities. The decoration of the book is famous for combining intricate detail with bold and energetic compositions. The characteristics of the Insular manuscript initial, as described by Carl Nordenfalk, here reach their most extreme realisation: ""initials ... are conceived as elastic forms expanding and contracting with a pulsating rhythm. The kinetic energy of their contours escapes into freely drawn appendices, a spiral line which in turn generates new curvilinear motifs..."".[36] The illustrations feature a broad range of colours, with purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow being the colours most often used. Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes: the Book of Durrow, for example, uses only four colours. As is usual with Insular work, there was no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript. The pigments for the illustrations, which included red and yellow ochre, green copper pigment (sometimes called verdigris), indigo, and possibly lapis lazuli,[37] would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and, in the case of the lapis lazuli, from northeast Afghanistan.[38] Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript, recent examination of the pigments has proven that lapis lazuli was not used.[37]

The lavish illumination programme is far greater than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. There are ten surviving full-page illuminations including two evangelist portraits, three pages with the four evangelist symbols, a carpet page, a miniature of the Virgin and Child, a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the Arrest of Jesus and the Temptation of Christ. There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first few words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration.[39]


Folio 2r of the Book of Kells contains one of the Eusebian Canons.
The extant folios of the manuscript start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly.[40] The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise the doctrine of the four Gospels' unity of message.

The unity of the Gospels is further emphasised by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the unity of the Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables).[40] The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.[41]


Folio 7v contains an image of the Virgin and Child. This is the oldest extant image of the Virgin Mary in a Western manuscript.
The remainder of the book is broken into sections with the divisions set off by miniatures and full pages of decorated text. Each of the Gospels is introduced by a consistent decorative programme. The preliminary matter is treated as one section and introduced by a lavish decorative spread. In addition to the preliminaries and the Gospels, the ""second beginning"" of the Gospel of Matthew is also given its own introductory decoration.

The preliminary matter is introduced by an iconic image of the Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.[42]

The miniature of the Virgin and Child faces the first page of text and is an appropriate preface to the beginning of the Breves Causae of Matthew, which begins Nativitas Christi in Bethlem (the birth of Christ in Bethlehem). The beginning page (folio 8r) of the text of the Breves Causae is decorated and contained within an elaborate frame. The two-page spread of the miniature and the text makes a vivid introductory statement for the prefatory material. The opening line of each of the sections of the preliminary matter is enlarged and decorated (see above for the Breves causae of Luke), but no other section of the preliminaries is given the same level of treatment as the beginning of the Breves Causae of Matthew.[42]


Folio 291v contains a portrait of John the Evangelist.
The book was designed so that each of the Gospels would have an elaborate introductory decorative programme. Each Gospel was originally prefaced by a full page miniature containing the four evangelist symbols, followed by a blank page. Then came a portrait of the evangelist which faced the opening text of the Gospel which was given an elaborate decorative treatment.[43] The Gospel of Matthew retains both its Evangelist portrait (folio 28v) and its page of Evangelist symbols (folio 27r, see above). The Gospel of Mark is missing the Evangelist portrait but retains its Evangelist symbols page (folio 129v). The Gospel of Luke is missing both the portrait and the Evangelist symbols page. The Gospel of John, like the Gospel of Matthew, retains both its portrait (folio 291v, see at right) and its Evangelist symbols page (folio 290v). It can be assumed that the portraits for Mark and Luke and the symbols page for Luke at one time existed but have been lost.[44] The use of all four of the Evangelist symbols in front of each Gospel is striking and was intended to reinforce the message of the unity of the Gospels.

The decoration of the opening few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. The decoration of these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis (""The book of the generation""). The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.[45]


Folio 29r contains the incipit to the Gospel of Matthew.
The border and the letters themselves are further decorated with elaborate spirals and knot work, many of them zoomorphic. The opening words of Mark, Initium evangelii (""The beginning of the Gospel""), Luke, Quoniam quidem multi, and John, In principio erat verbum (""In the beginning was the Word""), are all given similar treatments. Although the decoration of these pages was most extensive in the Book of Kells, these pages were decorated in all the other Insular Gospel Books.[46]

The Gospel of Matthew begins with a genealogy of Jesus. At Matthew 1:18, the actual narrative of Christ's life starts. This ""second beginning"" to Matthew was given emphasis in many early Gospel Books, so much so that the two sections were often treated as separate works. The second beginning begins with the word Christ. The Greek letters chi and rho were normally used in mediaeval manuscripts to abbreviate the word Christ. In Insular Gospel Books, the initial Chi Rho monogram was enlarged and decorated. In the Book of Kells, this second beginning was given a decorative programme equal to those that preface the individual Gospels.[45] Folio 32 verso has a miniature of Christ enthroned. (It has been argued that this miniature is one of the lost evangelist portraits. However, the iconography is quite different from the extant portraits, and current scholarship accepts this identification and placement for this miniature.) Facing this miniature, on folio 33 recto, is the only carpet page in the Book of Kells, which is rather anomalous; the Lindisfarne Gospels has five extant carpet pages and the Book of Durrow has six. The blank verso of folio 33 faces the single most lavish miniature of the early mediaeval period, the Book of Kells Chi Rho monogram, which serves as incipit for the narrative of the life of Christ.


Folio 34r contains the Chi Rho monogram.[47] Chi and rho are the first two letters of the word Christ in Greek.
In the Book of Kells, the Chi Rho monogram has grown to consume the entire page. The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across the majority of the page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started with the Book of Durrow.[45]

The Book of Kells contains two other full-page miniatures, which illustrate episodes from the Passion story. The text of Matthew is illustrated with a full-page illumination of the Arrest of Christ (folio 114r). Jesus is shown beneath a stylised arcade while being held by two much smaller figures.[48] In the text of Luke, there is a full sized miniature of the Temptation of Christ (folio 202v). Christ is shown from the waist up on top of the Temple. To his right is a crowd of people, perhaps representing his disciples. To his left and below him is a black figure of Satan. Above him hover two angels.[49]

The verso of the folio containing the Arrest of Christ contains a full page of decorated text which begins ""Tunc dicit illis"". Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another full page of decorated text (folio 203r ""Iesus autem plenus""). In addition to this page, five other full pages also receive elaborate treatment. In Matthew, there is one other full-page treatment (folio 124r, ""Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones""). In the Gospel of Mark, there are also two pages of decorated text (folio 183r, ""Erat autem hora tercia"", and folio 187v, ""[Et Dominus] quidem [Iesus] postquam""). The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text (folio 188v, ""Fuit in diebus Herodis "", and folio 285r, ""Una autem sabbati valde""). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them, it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed. There is no surviving full page of text in the Gospel of John other than the Incipit. However, in the other three Gospels, all the full pages of decorated text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative. However, since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained full pages of decorated text that have been lost.[50]
Almost all of the folios of the Book of Kells contain small illuminations like this decorated initial.
The decoration of the book is not limited to the major pages. Scattered through the text are decorated initials and small figures of animals and humans often twisted and tied into complicated knots. Many significant texts, such as the Pater Noster have decorated initials. The page containing text of the Beatitudes in Matthew (folio 40v) has a large miniature along the left margin of the page in which the letter B which begins each line is linked into an ornate chain. The genealogy of Christ found in the Gospel of Luke (folio 200r) contains a similar miniature in which the word qui is repeatedly linked along the left margin. Many of the small animals scattered throughout the text serve to mark a ""turn-in-the-path"" (that is, a place where a line is finished in a space above or below the original line). Many other animals serve to fill spaces left at the end of lines. No two of these designs are the same. No earlier surviving manuscript has this massive amount of decoration.


The decorations of the Book of Kells can be stunningly complex, as seen in this small detail of the Chi Rho monogram page. (Folio 34r)
The decorations are all high quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which occupies a one-inch square piece of a page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not known to have been available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs have also had an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.

The book had a sacramental rather than educational purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel would have been left on the high altar of the church and removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is significan","Allen Faber: This page marks the incipit or beginning of the 18 verse of Matthew I. The text reads: ""XPI autem generatio...."" The text of this verse in the Douay Rheims translation reads: ""Now the generation of Christ was in this wise.When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost."" Like other Hiberno-Saxon gospel books, notably the Lindisfarne Gospels, this text is given prominence. It almost serves as a second incipit for the Book of Matthew which begins with the Latin incipit: ""Liber generationis Iesu Christi..."" or in the Douay Rheims translation: ""The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham...."" The reason for this prominence can be connected to the importance of the doctrine of the ""Incarnation,"" which literally means ""into flesh."" The first 17 verses of the book of of Matthew recounts the earthly ancestry of Christ back to Abraham, while verse 18 marks the point of the Incarnation of Christ in the book of Matthew, the first of the Gospels in the manuscript. Remember that the text of the manuscript is written on parchment or animal skin. So that this page is literally ""the word made flesh,"" echoing the beginning of the book of John: ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."" This text captures how the Book of Kells and this page would be experienced by a monk using this book in the liturgy. Our experience of contemplating this page can be compared to the monastic experience of contemplating on the nature of Christ. Compare for example the following famous description of an Hiberno Saxon Gospel manuscript, perhaps the Book of Kells itself, written by the 12th century monk, Gerald of Canterbury (Topographia Hiberniae (1185)): ""This book contains the harmony of the four Evangelists according to St. Jerome, where for almost every page there are different designs, distinguished by varied colors. Here you may see the face of majesty, divinely drawn, here the mystic symbols of the Evangelists, each with wings, now six, now four, now two; here the Eagle, there the Calf, here the Man, and there the Lion, and other forms almost infinite. Look at them superficially with the ordinary casual glance, and you would think it an erasure, and not tracery. Fine craftsmanship is all about you, but you might not notice it. Look more keenly at it, and you will penetrate to the very shrine of art. You will make out intricacies, so delicate and subtle, so exact and compact, so full of knots and links, with colors so fresh and vivid, that you might say that all this was the work of an angel, and not of a man. For my part the oftener I see the book, and the more carefully I study it, the more I am lost in ever fresh amazement, and I see more and more wonders in the book."" To the following text written by Claudius of Turin describing the monastic experience of meditating on the Gospels: ""I published three books [on Genesis] from the sayings of the holy Fathers concerning the letter and the spirit... For the word came into the world by Mary, clad in flesh; and seeing was not understanding; all saw flesh; knowledge of the divinity was given to a chosen few. So when the Word was shown to men through the lawgiver and the prophets, it was not shown them without suitable vesture. There it is covered by the veil of flesh, here of the letter. The letter appears as flesh; but the spiritual sense within is known as divinity. This what we find in studying Leviticus... Blessed are the eyes which see divine spirit through the letter's veil."" 

Tom Lubbock: The Book of Kells is an illuminated manuscript of the four Christian gospels. It was made in Ireland, or possibly England, about AD800, by monks belonging to the Columban movement. In the Middle Ages it was kept in the Abbey of Kells in County Meath. It was designed as a treasure, a wonder. An old chronicle called it ""the chief relic of the Western world"". Modern opinion rates it the finest example of the ""insular"" (i.e. British Isles) gospel-books. One of its finest pages illuminates the Gospel according to St Matthew, chapter 1, verse 18. The Latin verse begins ""Christi autem generatio sic erat"" ¨C ""his is how Christ came to be born"". The page dwells almost entirely on the name of Christ, or rather on its traditional abbreviation into the ""Chi-Rho"" symbol (say it kai-roe). Chi and Rho are two letters of the Greek alphabet, the first two letters of ""Christ"". Chi gives a hard Ch sound. Rho is an R. Chi is written as an X. Rho is roughly a P. In this illumination the Chi is the dominant form, an X with uneven arms, somewhat resembling a pair of curvaceous pliers. The Rho stands in its shelter, with its loop turned into a spiral. There is also an Iota, an I, the third letter, passing up through this spiral. All three letters are abundantly decorated, their curves drawn out into flourishes, embellished with discs and spirals, filled with dense tracery and punctuated with occasional animals and angels. But put like that, it sounds as if the letters came first and the decoration after. The three letters, though visually distinct, are nowhere just letters. They have been shaped with a view to the patterns they will be part of, and they are themselves filled and formed by ornamental elements, like the diamond that makes the hinge of the X, and the head (Christ's?) that oddly finishes the P's spiral. Such decoration hates emptiness. Every space must be filled. It also resists contingency. It redeems writing from its arbitrary nature. The letter Chi might just as well be written like an O as an X. The name of Christ could take any shape. But buttressed and packed with pattern, the lettering becomes absolute, unalterable. Yet there is an aspect of contingency. The doodling principle is at the heart of this decoration, an additive improvisation in which one form breeds another, and lines of connection sprout, and become enclosures to be filled in, and the thing grows across the page until at some limit it stops. As with musical improvisation, part of the art of decoration is knowing how to bring things to a satisfactory stop. There is also an aspect of infinity. The letters are the biggest forms, and around them and within them things get smaller, smaller still, vanishingly small and faint. Recent commentary has compared these proliferating details to fractals. A medieval Welsh historian said: ""Look at them superficially with the ordinary glance, and you would think it is an erasure, and not tracery. Look more keenly at it and you will penetrate to the very shrine of art. You will make out intricacies, so delicate and so subtle, so full of knots and links, with colours so fresh and vivid, that you might say that all this were the work of an angel and not of a man.""r",,,,,,,,
19,La Vie,Pablo Picasso,oil on canvas,"Cubism, German Expressionism","La Vie (Zervos I 179) is an oil painting by Pablo Picasso, produced in 1903 during his Blue Period. La Vie was painted in Barcelona in May 1903. It measured 6 feet tall and 4 feet wide and portrayed two pairs of people, a naked couple confronting a mother bearing a child in her arms.[1] In the background of the room, apparently a studio, there are two paintings within the painting, the upper one showing a crouching and embracing nude couple, the lower one showing a lonesome crouching nude person very similar to Sorrow by Vincent Van Gogh. With this Picasso repainted another motif, a birdsman who attacks a reclining naked woman, traces of which are visible to the naked eye. Preparatory studies are: Private collection, Zervos XXII 44;[2] Paris, Musée Picasso, MPP 473;[3] Barcelona, Museu Picasso, MPB 101.507;[4] Barcelona, Museu Picasso, MPB 101.508.[5] It was painted at a time when Picasso was having no financial success. In contrast, the new painting sold only a month after it was finished, to a French art dealer, Jean Saint Gaudens. The sale was reported in the Barcelona newspaper, Liberal.[1] With La Vie Picasso repainted the canvas of The derniers Moments from 1899, a painting that he had presented at the Paris International Exhibition 1900.[6] The painting was given by the Hanna fund to the Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio in 1945 and is in their permanent collection.[7] The interpretation of the enigmatic composition has been the subject of much discussion.[8] The male figure clearly shows the portrait of Picassos friend, the painter Carlos Casagemas, who had committed suicide not a long time before Picasso created La Vie. X-ray photographs show that Picasso first executed a self-portrait that he later replaced by the portrait of his friend.[9] This fact and the circumstance that the confrontation of the two groups happens within a studio makes it verisimi""ar that self-reflective questions of the young artist are addressed in La Vie.[10] The crucial point indeed, scholars agree, seems to be the enigmatic gesture in the center of the composition. Only in 2003 Becht-J?rdens and Wehmeier recognized the wellknown painting ""Noli me tangere"", a masterpiece by Antonio da Correggio in the Museo del Prado, as the source for this gesture[11] and proposed an interpretation situated on two levels, the first, a biographical one that concerns the dyadic mother and child relationship and ""the mental trauma and feelings of guilt that result from the inevitable conflicts"" caused by detachment, the second, a self-referential one about the Messianic mission of the modern artist in the sense of Friedrich Nietzsche, ""his role in the world, and [...] the very essence of art"". The two levels of interpretation are ""interconnected by the significant role played by Picasso¡¯s mother"" who protected and adored her baby thus establishing some kind of cult of the divine child and by admiring her son and his first attempts ""encouraged him to follow his way and reinforced him in his self-perception as a genius"". The mother therefore can be seen as the representative of the artist¡®s ""irst audience, fascinated by his early mastership of academic art."" But to get an independent personality and to fulfill his mission as a modern artist for Picasso the detachment of both, the mother and the incomprending part of his audience that rejected his turn to modern art, is needed. ""As an answer to his confrontation with these difficulties, Picasso using further elements taken from the tradition of Christian art, for example the last supper, the resurrection, the veiled hands, presents himself both as Creator of a new art and its Messiah, who has come to comfort the suffering and redeem the world as a new Saviour, as a teacher of a new k","Cleveland Museum of Art: In 1901, depressed over the suicide of a close friend, Picasso launched into the melancholic paintings of his Blue Period (1901-4). Only 20 years old and desperately poor, he restricted his palette to cold colors suggestive of night, mystery, dreams, and death. His obsession with themes of human misery and social alienation reached its climax with this painting. The subject has been interpreted variously as an allegory of sacred and profane love, a symbolic representation of the cycle of life, and a working-class couple facing the hazards of real life.

20,Blue Mountain,Wassily Kandinsky,oil on canvas,"Impressionism, German Impressionism, Symbolism, Russian","In this work, the influence of the Fauves on Kandinsky's color palette is apparent as he distorted colors and moved away from the natural world. He presented a bright blue mountain, framed by a red and yellow tree on either side. In the foreground, riders on horseback charge through the scene. At this stage in Kandinsky's career, Saint John's Book of Revelation became a major literary source for his art, and the riders signify the four horsemen of the apocalypse. The horsemen, although an indicator of the mass destruction of the apocalypse, also represent the potential for redemption afterward. Kandinsky's vibrant palette and expressive brushwork provide the viewer with a sense of hope rather than despair. Further, the brilliant colors and dark outlines recall his love of the Russian folk art. These influences would remain part of Kandinsky's style throughout the rest of his career, with bright colors dominating his representational and non-objective canvases. From this figurative and highly symbolic work, Kandinsky progressed further towards pure abstraction. The forms are already schematized from their observable appearance in the surrounding world in this canvas, and his abstraction only progressed as Kandinsky refined his theories about art.

Britannica: Wassily Kandinsky, Russian in full Vasily Vasilyevich Kandinsky (born December 4 [December 16, New Style], 1866, Moscow, Russiadied December 13, 1944, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France) Russian-born artist, one of the first creators of pure abstraction in modern painting. After successful avant-garde exhibitions, he founded the influential Munich group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider; 191114) and began completely abstract painting. His forms evolved from fluid and organic to geometric and, finally, to pictographic (e.g., Tempered Élan, 1944). In Blue Mountain (1908) the evolution toward nonrepresentation is already clearly under way; the forms are schematic, the colours nonnaturalistic, and the general effect that of a dream landscape.

Wikipedia: Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky (/kænÈdjnski/; Russian: 0A8;89 0A8;L528G 0=48=A:89, Vasiliy Vasilyevich Kandinskiy, pronounced [vaÈs²il²jj kPnÈd²insk²jj]; 16 December [O.S. 4 December] 1866  13 December 1944) was an influential Russian painter and art theorist. He is credited with painting one of the first purely abstract works. Kandinsky's creation of abstract work followed a long period of development and maturation of intense thought based on his artistic experiences. He called this devotion to inner beauty, fervor of spirit, and spiritual desire inner necessity; it was a central aspect of his art. n 1909 he joined the Theosophical Society. The Blue Mountain (1908¨C1909) was painted at this time, demonstrating his trend toward abstraction. A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red. A p","Guggenheim: Blue Mountain ( Der blaue Berg ) Vasily Kandinsky¡¯s use of the horse-and-rider motif symbolized his crusade against conventional aesthetic values and his dream of a better, more spiritual future through the transformative powers of art. The rider is featured in many woodcuts, temperas, and oils, from its first appearance in the artist¡¯s folk-inspired paintings, executed in his native Russia at the turn of the century, to his abstracted landscapes made in Munich during the early 1910s. The horseman was also incorporated into the cover designs for Kandinsky¡¯s theoretical manifesto of 1911, On the Spiritual in Art, and the contemporaneous Blue Rider Almanac, which he coedited with Franz Marc.
